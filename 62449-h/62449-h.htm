<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>The life story of Maximilian First in Mexico
is one of the saddest of tragedies. Admitting
that he was in some respects a weak
sovereign and incompetent for the task he undertook,
the tragedy is none the less sad. The dreadful
fate which overtook the Empress Carlotta only adds
to the gloom of the situation, and, if all reports are
true, serves to emphasize Mexican cruelty and
treachery, for in official circles it is generally believed
she was made insane by a poisonous herb secretly
mixed with her drink. Maximilian himself was a
gentleman in the best sense of the term, gentle,
courteous, refined, and scholarly; unfitted for the
position he held, inexperienced in political matters,
and ignorant how to contend with guile and treachery
of the basest kind. He was virtually forced to
ascend the Mexican throne, and consented only when
he was assured that the Mexican people had enthusiastically
elected him. Once there, he found himself
the victim of treacherous plots and deadly hatred.
He had but few friends upon whom he could rely,
and they were unable to aid him in the hour of
greatest danger. Louis Napoleon, who was chiefly
instrumental in sending him there, violated his
agreements, withdrew the French troops from
Mexico, and abandoned him as a prey to his vindictive
enemies, at whose hands he died like a gentleman
and a hero, leaving the Empress to suffer
the tortures of living death in a European asylum.
History recalls few sadder tragedies than the one
contained in the story of Maximilian&rsquo;s three years
in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Maximilian in Mexico</h2>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian</span></h2>
<p>Ferdinand Maximilian, born at Sch&ouml;nbrunn
on the sixth of July, 1832, was the
second son of Archduke Charles of Austria
and the Archduchess Sophie of Bavaria, a clever
and highly cultivated princess, under whose personal
supervision the young Archduke received a
careful and thorough education, in which Count
Bombelles, whose son afterward accompanied Maximilian
to Mexico, also had an important share.</p>
<p>From early childhood the prince showed that
marked love of nature, and especially of the sea,
which was so characteristic of his later years and
which made his education for the navy&mdash;his destined
career&mdash;an easy and pleasant task. To this
chosen profession, indeed, he applied himself with
such zeal and devotion that he may be regarded
as the real founder of the Austrian navy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>His leisure hours were devoted to the study of
the fine arts and to the practice of all sorts of athletic
pursuits, in which he excelled, being tall and
well built, and quick and elastic in all his motions.</p>
<p>In 1850, upon the completion of his scientific
studies, he made his first long cruise, to Greece and
Smyrna, followed by voyages to Spain, Portugal, and
Algiers. In 1853 he was made captain of a corvette,
and a year later received the appointment of commander-in-chief
of the navy, soon after which,
escorted by a squadron of seventeen warships, he
visited Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Palestine.</p>
<p>The years 1856-57 were spent chiefly in European
travel, during which time the Archduke made the
acquaintance of his future wife, the Princess Carlotta,
daughter of King Leopold Second of Belgium,
to whom he was married in 1857 and who proved so
loyal and devoted a companion in joy and sorrow
until overtaken by the tragic fate of which we shall
hear later. Soon after his marriage, Maximilian,
then only in his twenty-fifth year, was made governor-general
of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom
by his brother, the Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria&mdash;an office which he held for two years,
and which served in some measure as a preparation
for his subsequent mission in Mexico for, as governor-general,
he had many difficulties to contend
with, even though they were of quite a different
nature from those that afterward confronted him
in America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The war that broke out in 1859 between Italy
and Austria put an end to Maximilian&rsquo;s political
career and he retired to the seclusion of Miramar,
the beautiful palace erected at Trieste some years
before. Here he lived quietly and peacefully, occupied
with his favorite literary and artistic pursuits,
and it was here that he wrote the &ldquo;Sketches of
Travel,&rdquo; afterward published; also the &ldquo;Aphorisms,&rdquo;
which speak the thoughts and aspirations of a great
soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Maximilian has been called weak and irresolute,
and in fact he did prove hopelessly unequal to the
task that was set for him in Mexico&mdash;a task far
less suited to his gentle, kindly nature than to the
bolder character of his rival, Juarez, a man of
quite another stamp, who hesitated at no means to
attain his ends and for whom the high-minded
Hapsburger was no match. That Maximilian made
many grave errors cannot be denied, but his entire
administration should not be condemned for that
reason. It is certain that he was inspired by the
noblest aims and intentions, and had the Mexicans
but realized this and given him their loyal support
his plans might have been realized and ensured both
the country&rsquo;s welfare and his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Mexican Empire</span></h2>
<p>During the Archduke&rsquo;s travels, in 1856, he
had visited Paris and spent twelve days at
St. Cloud with Napoleon Third and Eug&eacute;nie.
He became much interested in the Emperor&rsquo;s
ambitious schemes, while Napoleon and his wife on
their part were so pleased with Maximilian&rsquo;s frank
and manly character that by the time he took his
departure the French sovereigns had already made
plans for the future of their guest, the situation in
Mexico offering a favorable opportunity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The better class of Mexicans were anxious for a
strong hand to assume the reins of government and
restore order to that distracted and wellnigh ruined
land, and as Napoleon Third was then in control of
affairs there, it was an easy matter for him to arouse
the interest of the Mexicans in the young Archduke
as their prospective ruler. The throne of Mexico
therefore was duly offered to Maximilian, but he
was at first unwilling to accept it. Fully acquainted
with the disordered state of that country, there was
little temptation for him to exchange the peaceful
seclusion of Miramar for so doubtful a gift. Negotiations
were carried on for eight months between
Paris and Miramar before the Archduke would consent
to accept the crown. At length, however, he
agreed on condition that both France and England
would guarantee their support in this enterprise.
Further delays were caused by discussions between
France, Spain, and England, but not until England
and Spain had finally yielded and withdrawn all
their troops from Mexico did Napoleon fully realize
the complications of the situation there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Maximilian at Miramar became devoted
to the idea of being Emperor of Mexico, being
principally actuated by the fact that his wife would
be an Empress. Both applied themselves closely to
the study not only of the geography but of the
language and customs of the country, actively corresponding
at the same time with those who might
be able to exert an influence upon the destinies of
Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The first public negotiations were conducted in
person by Napoleon Third and the Emperor Francis
Joseph of Austria, the latter of whom sent his
minister, Count Rechberg, to Miramar to discuss
the matter with his brother Maximilian. Both the
Archduke and his wife attached great weight to the
opinion of her father, King Leopold, who was well
known as a shrewd and clear-headed thinker. He
pointed out plainly the dangers and difficulties
attendant on assuming the sovereignty of Mexico,
but did not regard them as insurmountable, and his
advice decided the question. Maximilian announced
himself ready to accept the throne on certain conditions,
the chief of which was that his choice
as Emperor should be confirmed by a vote of the
Mexican people.</p>
<p>On the third of October, 1863, an embassy from
Mexico arrived at Miramar with a formal offer of
the crown. It was headed by Don Gutierrez de
Estrada, who had labored for twenty years to restore
a monarchy in Mexico. Maximilian&rsquo;s reply was as
follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am deeply moved by the wishes of the Mexican
assembly. It is most flattering to our house that their
choice should have fallen on a descendant of Charles
the Fifth. Yet noble and lofty a mission as it is
to establish the welfare and independence of Mexico,
I agree with the Emperor Napoleon that the monarchy
can be restored on a firm and stable basis only
by the free consent of the people. My acceptance
must therefore be conditional on that. On the other
hand, it shall be my duty to secure the guarantees
necessary to protect Mexico against the dangers
that menace her honor and her liberties. If I succeed
in this and the vote of the people be in my
favor, then I shall be ready, with the consent of my
imperial brother, to accept the crown. Should
Providence call me to this high mission, it is my
firm intention, after the pacification of the country,
to open the way for progress by granting a constitution
and to make this fundamental law permanent
by an oath. Only in this way can a new and truly
national policy be created, by means of which all
parties, forgetting their differences, may work with
me to lift Mexico to an eminent place among the
nations. Bring me this declaration, then, on the part
of your fellow-citizens and, if possible, ascertain what
form of government they desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a frank and manly answer, and no doubt
the emissaries of the Mexican people who carried it
back across the Atlantic were equally honorable in
their intentions. How the vote was really obtained,
however, is told us by Montlong:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>At Monterey the French general, Jeanningres,
summoned the most influential citizens and addressed
them thus: &ldquo;The Emperor of the French, always
solicitous for the welfare of this unhappy country, has
determined to transform the Mexican republic into
a great and prosperous empire, and in the interests
of this undertaking has chosen for your Emperor
one of the most liberal and enlightened princes in
Europe, the Archduke Maximilian of Austria. But
as Napoleon wishes him to be elected by general
consent of the people I have summoned you here in
order to receive your votes.&rdquo; Then with a threatening
glance he added: &ldquo;You accept, do you not,
gentlemen, the prince chosen for you by the Emperor
Napoleon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Intimidated by the General&rsquo;s manner and the
ranks of soldiery behind him, all replied in
the affirmative, whereupon Jeanningres, addressing
the general staff officer who was to record the votes,
ordered him: &ldquo;Write, sir, that this city votes unanimously
for the Empire, and permit these gentlemen
to sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The same method of procedure was enacted in
every town. When the principal citizens of Potosi
refused to sign a similar document, the officer in
command caused them all to be imprisoned for
thirty-six hours till hunger forced them to yield.
Thus by fraud the Empire was founded, as by
treachery it fell, both marked characteristics of this
nation as we shall see later.</p>
<p>The way now seemed clear, but at the last moment
an unforeseen difficulty arose. While the Archduke
was making a round of farewell visits at various
European courts, it was decided at Vienna to demand
a renunciation of all rights of succession to the throne
of Austria on the part of Maximilian and his possible
descendants. Emperor Francis Joseph strongly opposed
this, justly maintaining that if such a step
were considered necessary, it should not have been
deferred till the last moment, but Count Rechberg
and Baron Lichtenfels were firm. The former undertook
to lay the matter before the Archduke on his
return, but was so coldly received that he abandoned
any further attempt, while Maximilian himself
declared that had this point been presented to
him earlier, negotiations with Mexico would have
been broken off at once. This, of course, was now out
of the question, and after much discussion he finally
agreed to sign the act of renunciation, thus removing
the last obstacle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>On the tenth of April, 1864, a second embassy,
consisting of twenty distinguished Mexicans, again
headed by Estrada, arrived at Miramar to perform
the coronation ceremony. In his address, spoken
in French, Don Gutierrez alluded, first of all, to the
gratifying result of the popular vote. As to the
method by which it had been secured the good man
probably had as little knowledge as Maximilian himself.
He then recalled France&rsquo;s service to his native
country, whose future prosperity he hoped would be
assured under the new monarchy. Mexico gratefully
acknowledged the Archduke&rsquo;s self-sacrifice in
accepting this difficult position and was ready to
hail with joy her chosen sovereign, whose motto
was, <i>Justitia regnorum fundamentum</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Maximilian&rsquo;s reply was in Spanish. He declared
that since the two conditions required by him had
been fulfilled, he was now able to redeem the promise
given six months before and was ready to accept the
offered crown. The oath was then administered.
Maximilian swore to guard the liberties of the Mexican
nation under all circumstances and to do all in
his power for the welfare and prosperity of the
people, after which Estrada swore allegiance in the
name of Mexico and was decorated by his sovereign
with the grand cross of the newly revived Guadeloupe
order. A triple &ldquo;Viva&rdquo; followed to the new
Emperor and Empress in whose honor the imperial
Mexican flag was hoisted on the tower of Miramar,
amidst salvos from batteries and battle ships. A
solemn Te Deum in the palace chapel concluded the
ceremonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>On the same day the Emperor signed the important
convention with Napoleon, known as the Treaty
of Miramar, whereby it was agreed to reduce the
French troops as soon as possible to 25,000, including
the foreign legion. This body should evacuate
the country as soon as forces could be organized to
take their place, yet the foreign legion of 8000 was
to remain, if required, for six years after the above
withdrawal and be supported from this time by the
Mexican government. The transport service for
French military supplies must be paid by the same
government with 400,000 francs for the round trip,
likewise the cost of the French expedition, fixed at
270,000,000 francs for the whole time, till July 1,
1864, with interest at three per cent per annum.
After this date the expenses of the Mexican army
rested with Mexico, which had also to give 1000
francs for the maintenance of each French soldier,
pay included. Against these sums the Mexican
government had to pay at once 66,000,000 francs in
bonds of the late loan and 25,000,000 francs in
specie annually. A mixed commission of three
Frenchmen and three Mexicans was to meet at
Mexico within three months to adjust the claims of
French citizens. All Mexican prisoners of war held
by the French were to be released as soon as Maximilian
entered his States. In addition to this,
there were three secret clauses, by utilizing which
France afterward, and not without some show of
reason, attempted to extricate herself from her dangerous
position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Arrival of the Emperor in Mexico</span></h2>
<p>On the tenth of April, 1864, the die was cast
for Archduke Maximilian and Carlotta. On
the fourteenth, the day set for departure,
all was bustle and confusion at Miramar, usually so
peaceful. The harbor of Trieste was filled with
vessels, large and small, and, anchored at some distance
from shore, lay the <i>Novara</i>, the Austrian warship
that was to convey the imperial pair to Mexico.
Little did any one then suspect that this same
vessel was so soon to bring back the body of Maximilian,
cruelly murdered by Mexican rebels! To-day
all was joyous anticipation. A gayly decorated
barge carried the Emperor and Empress out to the
<i>Novara</i>. Showers of blossoms were flung after them
as they left the shore, lined with thousands of spectators,
and floated gently out upon the blue waves
of the Adriatic. Cannon thundered a farewell.
Maximilian looked for the last time upon his native
shores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Two nights later the travellers rounded the southernmost
point of Italy, and on the eighteenth
reached Civita Vecchia where they landed and were
met by the French and Italian ambassadors, envoys
from Belgium and Austria, and the Cardinals sent
by Pope Pius Ninth to welcome Maximilian. A special
train was waiting to convey the entire party
to Rome where, on the nineteenth of April, the
Emperor had an audience with the Pope. Church
affairs in Mexico had been completely demoralized
by Juarez, and one of the Emperor&rsquo;s chief tasks was
to restore order and provide for the religious needs
of his people. The following day Pope Pius Ninth
returned the visit at the Palazzo Marescotti, after
which the imperial party returned to Civita Vecchia,
where they again boarded the <i>Novara</i> and resumed
their voyage. At Gibraltar another stop of two
days was made, and on the twenty-eighth of May
the <i>Novara</i> anchored before the city of Vera Cruz.
The goal was reached&mdash;but what of Maximilian&rsquo;s
reception by the people of Mexico who had chosen
him as their sovereign by a unanimous vote?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Although the French frigate <i>Themis</i>, which escorted
the <i>Novara</i> across the Atlantic, had hastened
on in advance to notify the city of the Emperor&rsquo;s
arrival, there was no commotion in the harbor. No
flags were flying, no guns roared a welcome, no one
was waiting to receive him. A feeling of uneasiness
pervaded the Emperor&rsquo;s household, but Maximilian
himself made no comment. After a long delay
the commander-in-chief of the French fleet, Rear-admiral
Bosse, and his adjutant finally made their
appearance, though even then, according to the
Countess Kollowitz, their greeting was none too
warm. Quite different, however, was the Emperor&rsquo;s
reception in the towns between Vera Cruz and
Mexico; his journey to the capital was like a triumphal progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Thus did Maximilian enter the land that was
henceforth to claim his whole attention and best
endeavor. For this indifferent and ungrateful people
he had undertaken the Herculean task of regenerating
a country wasted by forty years of civil warfare;
regulating a society demoralized by anarchy; restoring
national prosperity; reviving industries; and
reconciling to law and order a people to whom outlawry
and robbery had become second nature.
The army must be reorganized, the land rid of
marauders, contending factions appeased and made
to work together for the common good. The Church
must be placed once more on a settled basis, new
channels of trade established, and the whole national
standard of civilization raised. These were surely
problems to daunt the bravest! Well may Maximilian
have hesitated long before accepting such
responsibilities, yet with heroic self-sacrifice the
young Emperor set himself to this stupendous work.
That he failed was no doubt due partly to his unfitness
for the task, but more to the insuperable obstacles
that loomed before and finally crushed the
noble Hapsburger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Maximilian&rsquo;s First Measures</span></h2>
<p>One of the first necessities that confronted
Maximilian in the execution of his mission
was the establishment of diplomatic relations
with the world. The courts of Vienna, Rome,
Paris, and Brussels had been informed at once of his
acceptance of the throne of Mexico. It now remained
to notify the remaining powers of this event.
A decree was issued on the twenty-first of June,
1864, empowering the foreign office to make the
necessary arrangements. By the end of the year
Mexico had been recognized as an Empire by Russia,
Sweden, Turkey, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Italy,
France, and England, also by the German Confederation
and the Shah of Persia. Far more valuable to
the new monarchy would have been its recognition
by the United States, but the White House at Washington
still looked upon Juarez as President of
Mexico, as did its smaller and less important
neighbors on the south, the republics of Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, San Salvador, and Costa Rica.
Thus the Empire was surrounded by hostile countries,
while its only ally in America, the Emperor
Don Pedro Second of Brazil, could be of little use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Maximilian appointed the advocate Don Jos&eacute;
Ramirez as minister of foreign affairs&mdash;a man concerning
whom opinion is divided. There can be no
question, however, as to his ability and his loyalty
to Maximilian, to whom he proved a valuable counsellor,
although the Emperor unfortunately did not
always follow his advice. Maximilian took no further
action in governmental affairs until he had
gained a more intimate knowledge of the country.
Though well versed in the language and history of
Mexico as well as its political complications, he
discovered at once the necessity of a personal
acquaintance with the various portions of his new
realm and determined to make a tour of those
provinces loyal to him. Meanwhile he devoted
himself to learning the needs of his people. With
this object in view he spent much time walking
about the streets of the capital or visiting various
public and charitable institutions. The Empress
was her husband&rsquo;s constant companion, sharing all
his cares and interests, and although Maximilian did
not always agree with her opinions, her clever pen,
her quick wit, and cultivated mind often proved of
great help to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>He soon discovered many evils the existence of
which he had not suspected. The Mexican is profuse
in promises which are never kept, and Maximilian
had daily proof of this national characteristic.
In spite of his personal charm and kindness the
French officers kept jealously aloof from him, regarding
themselves as slighted in the distribution of
orders. The clergy, disappointed that the Church
property confiscated by Juarez had not been immediately
restored to them, were dissatisfied with the
new government, while the republicans under Juarez
refused, of course, to acknowledge the Empire.</p>
<p>The accusation made by these malcontents that
Maximilian did not attempt to improve conditions
was entirely unjustified, however. Few that followed
his career realized how diligently and self-sacrificingly
he labored for that end. That the
restoration of order must be gradually accomplished
was self-evident. Realizing that drastic measures
were necessary at many points in the affairs of
state, he was forced to take time for observation
and investigation before attempting any change.
Many evils had to be endured temporarily before
any radical changes could be made, and he had also
to consult the opinions of his advisers, whether in
accordance with his own or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>His first attention was devoted to the regulation
of military and financial matters. A commission,
headed by General Bazaine, commander-in-chief of
the French troops, was appointed to meet on the
fourteenth of July to consider the reorganization of
the army. The relations between Maximilian and
this officer had been none too friendly from the
first. Bazaine considered himself his own master
and troubled himself little as to the Emperor&rsquo;s
views. In justice to Napoleon Third, however, it
must be said that he seems to have been very imperfectly
informed as to the actions and practices
of his generals in Mexico. All correspondence with
France had to pass through the hands of Bazaine
or his subordinates, who could easily color reports
to suit themselves. On the fifteenth of July a
commission, presided over by Velasquez de Leon,
and consisting of landed proprietors, merchants,
manufacturers, and mine owners, met to discuss the
regulation of financial affairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>From the first Maximilian exerted himself to do
away with antiquated customs, and as early as the
sixteenth of July a decree was issued requiring all
officers of justice to be at their posts from nine to
twelve in the morning and shortening their annual
leave of absence from three months to six weeks, an
innovation that met with small favor from the
Mexicans, as may be imagined.</p>
<p>On the tenth of August the Emperor set out
upon his tour into the interior, the government
during his absence being left in charge of the Empress.
He was accompanied by his life-long friend,
Count Bombelles, his secretary, Iglesias, Privy Councillor
Scherzenlechner, and the Lord Chamberlain
Felipe Raygosa. Originally planned for four weeks,
the journey extended over three months. A proclamation
had been issued by Velasquez de Leon,
shortly before the Emperor&rsquo;s departure, announcing
his tour and forbidding any state receptions or entertainments
in order to spare expense to the people,
impoverished by years of civil strife. In spite of
this prohibition, however, magnificent triumphal
arches were erected in many places in honor of the
Emperor, who was welcomed with great enthusiasm
by the populace, the Indians, in particular, gathering
in crowds everywhere to gaze at their new sovereign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>On the seventeenth of August Maximilian arrived
at Quer&eacute;taro where he was received with great
enthusiasm and remained for several days, being
royally entertained. Little did any of those who
joined in the festivities suspect that in this very
town, only three years later, the Emperor was to
lay down his life for Mexico! From there he went
on to Celaya which was reached a week later. In
many places through which they passed evidences
were visible of the effects of the famine that existed
in the interior of the country, and where the suffering
was greatest Maximilian distributed considerable
sums of money from his own purse. At Trapuato
the Emperor was suddenly seized with an attack
of quinsy which confined him to his bed for two
weeks. This delay, together with other unforeseen
occurrences in the capital, obliged him to abandon
the rest of his journey, and the party returned to
Mexico, though by a different route, arriving on the
thirtieth of October.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>This tour of Maximilian&rsquo;s had proved a continuous
ovation, but how much of the popular enthusiasm
was due to his personality rather than to
allegiance to him as a sovereign is a question. He
had shown himself everywhere most gracious and
kindly, granting audiences to persons of all classes
with a fearlessness which, considering the state of
the country, must have commanded the respect even
of his enemies. Whether he allowed himself to be
deceived by these demonstrations is uncertain. At
all events he returned well content with the results
of his journey and full of hope for the future. That
many of the great changes planned by him for the
benefit of the people were never put into execution
was not altogether his fault. To carry out any
thorough system of reform large sums of money
are needed, and the treasury was exhausted.</p>
<p>Maximilian&rsquo;s first act after his return was to form
a ministry. During his travels he had met many
able and patriotic Mexicans who, he fancied, would
be of great assistance to him in his projected reforms,
and from these he chose his ministers exclusively,
though doubtless well aware that in some cases the
positions would have been better filled by Austrians,
Belgians, or Frenchmen. When reminded of
this by his friends, however, he would say, &ldquo;Have
patience! When the country learns that Mexican
ministers are good-for-nothing, I may be justified in
appointing others, and my people can then have
nothing to reproach me with.&rdquo; This was no doubt
wise on the Emperor&rsquo;s part. The appointment of
foreigners would have excited suspicion if not rebellion
at once among the excitable and distrustful
Mexicans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>On his tour Maximilian had discovered that the
country&rsquo;s most pressing need was the revival of
commerce. New channels of trade must be created,
and for this purpose the laying out of highways
and the building of bridges was ordered. Robles,
minister of public works, was commissioned to build
a railroad between Quer&eacute;taro and Guanajuato, an
undertaking which was never carried out, however.
A railroad from Mexico to Vera Cruz was also
planned, the execution of which was entrusted to
an English company, and three different companies
received permission to run steamship lines between
the more important seaports of the country. To
exterminate the robber bands and secure safety
for the life and property of the people, a much
needed system of militia was instituted on the
seventh of November, 1864. At the same time
the Emperor urged most strictly upon all magistrates
of the various provinces the following injunctions:
preservation of law and order, firm
administration of justice, supervision of the press,
construction and maintenance of roads, extermination
of marauders and outlaws, sanitation, improvements
in agriculture and the breeding of cattle,
conservation of forests, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>All this proves the loftiness of Maximilian&rsquo;s aims&mdash;nor
were his hands idle as some of his enemies
maliciously maintained. Could he but have had
the necessary support and co&ouml;peration, conditions
in that unfortunate country must soon have improved.
But with only the fickle and treacherous
Mexicans to depend upon, all these reforms were of
brief duration&mdash;a mere ripple on the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Church Affairs in Mexico</span></h2>
<p>The most difficult problem now awaiting solution
was the religious situation in Mexico.
Forty years of internal strife and anarchy
had inevitably lowered the standards of the people
and weakened their sense of right and wrong, as was
proved by Juarez&rsquo;s treatment of Church property.
The claim of the enemies of the Catholic Church,
however, that the priesthood was responsible for
this moral degradation, is entirely without foundation.
All reports agree that the priests were then,
as now, the friends and guardians of the Indians.
Many of the stanchest supporters of Mexican independence&mdash;among
them Hidalgo, Morelos, and
Guerrero&mdash;belonged to the clerical party, and even
at the present day a large part of the minor clergy
are Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Accounts vary as to the value of the Church&rsquo;s
property in Mexico at that time, but it is a matter
of little importance, since it had been seized and
disposed of by Juarez and his followers long before
Maximilian&rsquo;s arrival. Indeed, this had been one of
the chief causes for the latter&rsquo;s hesitation in accepting
the throne.</p>
<p>The only possible method of dealing with this
knotty question seemed to be that of direct negotiation
with the papal chair, and a special envoy was
sent to Mexico by Pope Pius Ninth for this purpose.
The nuncio, Monsignore Meglia, was received by
Maximilian with every mark of honor and escorted
in state to the capital where a round of festivities
ensued, after which the Emperor and his guest
devoted themselves to the matter in hand. Nine
points were submitted by Maximilian and his ministers
for debate, the chief of which may be briefly
stated as follows: Free observance of all religions in
Mexico, in so far as they did not violate the laws
of the country; all expenses of Catholic worship to
be borne by the State; no taxes nor gratuities of any
kind to be paid to the clergy by the people; cession
by the Church of all possessions declared to be
national property; enjoyment by the Emperor of all
rights possessed by his predecessors, the Kings of
Spain, in Mexico; a mutual agreement to exist
between the Pope and the Emperor to resist aggression
on the part of any or all religious orders in
Mexico; existing communities to remain on condition
that no more novices be received until conditions
were settled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The delicate nature of these matters may readily
be perceived as well as the difficulty of their settlement.
Negotiations, in fact, were soon broken off
and an uncomfortable open rupture occurred between
the Emperor&rsquo;s ministers and Monsignore Meglia,
who left the capital with his suite on the twenty-seventh
of May, and returned to Rome without
having accomplished his mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Enemies Within and Without</span></h2>
<p>Maximilian&rsquo;s failure to settle this question,
so important to Mexico, not only was of
the greatest detriment to the restoration
of peace and order, but also lost him the sympathies
of the clerical party, already averse to the new
sovereignty.</p>
<p>The unsettled condition of the country has been
already alluded to. It is impossible for peaceful
industries to flourish where the lives and property
of citizens are in constant danger. The path of outlawry
and anarchy is marked only by mouldering
corpses and smoking ruins. Some idea of the state
of things may be obtained from a report sent by
the prefect of Zamora to his chief, Antonio Moral,
on the ninth of March, 1865:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;This prefecture has learned through spies and
other sources of information that the robber chiefs
Regules, Salazar, Egiulus, and others are assembling
their bands in large numbers for attack. Should
the troops stationed at Mazamitla and Uruapan be
withdrawn, the bandits will capture this town without
a doubt, an event which would be followed by
the most serious consequences. I must add that all
towns in the south of this department are in the
same danger, and earnestly implore aid. Pazcuaro
is menaced by more than 1400 outlaws. Unless
General Neigre, who has been informed of the danger,
speedily sends assistance, it will fall into their
hands and a terrible catastrophe be precipitated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the tenth of May, 1865, the Mexican commander-in-chief,
Vicente Rosas, writes to the minister
of war:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matters are bad and grow worse daily. Besides
the bands of Regules and Pueblita, several others
are roving about in this vicinity, plundering and
burning <i>haciendas</i>. Unless something can be done
to remedy affairs, this whole department will be
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The country&rsquo;s most serious enemy, however, was
its ex-President, Benito Juarez. Born about 1807,
in the State of Oaxaca, of an Indian family, claiming
descent from Zapotekos, Juarez&rsquo;s childhood was
spent in extreme poverty. With a natural thirst
for knowledge, he eagerly availed himself of all the
opportunities for learning that came within his
reach, and, finally succeeding in obtaining some
education, he determined to devote himself to the
study of law. A wealthy Indian merchant, named
Don Jos&eacute; Hernandez, had taken him into his service
as errand-boy from which position he soon rose to
a clerkship, and afterward was admitted to the bar
with the dignity of Doctor of Laws. Later he was
elected to the Vice-Presidency under Comonfort,
upon whose resignation, in 1858, Juarez became
President of Mexico.</p>
<p>When Maximilian assumed the throne, Juarez&rsquo;s
term of office had nearly expired (November 30,
1864). He would have been wise therefore to recognize
the Empire, under which he might have looked
to hold some important position. Maximilian, indeed,
did make overtures to the ex-President by
offering him a place in the cabinet, but Juarez coldly
declined, preferring to remain at the head of the
revolutionists, who kept Mexico in a state of
turmoil and effectually prevented any peaceful development
of that distracted country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The position taken by the United States toward
the new Empire has already been alluded to. On
the fourth of April, 1864, Congress adopted a resolution
declaring the unwillingness of the United States
tacitly to appear before the world as an indifferent
spectator of the deplorable events then taking place
in Mexico, and its refusal to recognize a monarchical
government founded on the ruins of an American
republic and under the protection of a European
power.</p>
<p>Much to his regret, therefore, Maximilian was
forced to abandon all thought of an embassy at
Washington. Realizing fully how great an advantage
recognition by the United States would have
been to the Empire, both he and his ministers had
used every effort to establish friendly relations between
the two governments. The White House,
however, still continued to recognize Juarez and his
ambassador, Romero, a crafty official who succeeded,
not only in establishing recruiting offices for
his master in some of the large cities of the United
States, but in winning over many of the newspapers
also to his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Bazaine&rsquo;s Position in Mexico</span></h2>
<p>The attitude taken by the French in Mexico
has already been alluded to. Bazaine in
particular seems from the first to have been
little affected by the Emperor&rsquo;s good example. He
was well aware of France&rsquo;s incalculable services to
Mexico, and that it was French bayonets chiefly
which still maintained some show of order in the
country. As for Maximilian, while thoroughly appreciating
Bazaine&rsquo;s ability, he could not but regard
him as the man of whose will he was more or less
at the mercy, and felt most keenly the arbitrary
acts of the Marshal and his underlings, of which the
following examples will serve as illustrations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>In 1864 the French general, Briancourt, had a
Mexican colonel arrested and forced him to sweep
the streets for two hours every day. Indignant at
this outrage, some ladies of the town brought
wreaths of flowers to the colonel as he swept, whereupon
Briancourt had bills posted proclaiming that in
the future any one who committed this offence should
share the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence. After being humiliated
in this way for ten days, the imperial officer was
summoned before Briancourt, who dismissed him
with the words: &ldquo;Go where you choose now&mdash;over
to the republicans&mdash;for all I care!&rdquo; And the
colonel actually did join the Emperor&rsquo;s enemies, with
several other officers.</p>
<p>A French officer, meeting one of his comrades
who had served through a campaign under Lieutenant-colonel
Ornano, congratulated him on having
been one of those receiving decorations for bravery.
&ldquo;You do me an injustice!&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;We
invariably turned our backs upon the enemy and
if Ornano singled me out in his report, it was only
through fear lest I might betray how it was falsified.
Let me tell you just one incident of this honorable
campaign. As we were approaching the village of
San Francisco, Ornano sent a party of cavalry in
advance to reconnoitre. A fifteen-year-old boy, attracted
by the sound of riders, came to the door of
his house to see who they were, and, as he galloped
by, the leader of the patrol split the poor child&rsquo;s
skull with one stroke of his sabre, just as his mother
was about to draw him back into the house. Truly
a heroic deed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>These examples will suffice to prove with what
contempt the French regarded the Mexicans and
how the officers especially lost no opportunity of
turning the Emperor&rsquo;s subjects against him, even
while they themselves were still supposed to be in
Maximilian&rsquo;s service. It would be unjust, however,
to accuse the whole army of this treacherous behavior,
nor can Napoleon Third be held responsible
for it. He was a warm personal friend of Maximilian
in the first place, and it seems reasonable to
assume that he was ignorant of such conduct on the
part of Bazaine or he would have recalled him and
sent some one else in his place.</p>
<p>On the third of October, 1865, a report having
been generally circulated that Juarez had fled from
Mexico and taken refuge in Texas, the Emperor
issued a decree for which he has been severely criticised.
It ran in substance as follows: All persons
belonging to armed bands or companies, political or
otherwise, not lawfully authorized, under whatever
appellation or for whatever purpose, shall be tried
by court-martial, and if found guilty shall be condemned
to death and executed within twenty-four
hours from the date of sentence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Bazaine is believed by some to have been the real
author of this edict, which was aimed at the destruction
of the robber bands that infested the country,
but by authority of which Maximilian himself was
afterward sentenced to death by Juarez. As, however,
it was signed by all Maximilian&rsquo;s liberal
ministers it seems more probable that they were
responsible for a decree so little in accordance with
his kindly nature.</p>
<p>Whether or no Bazaine had any share in the framing
of this edict, he certainly did all in his power to
further its execution, as appears from a confidential
message to his generals sent with a copy of the decree.
He concludes, &ldquo;You are hereby commanded
to notify the troops under your orders that no more
prisoners are to be taken. All individuals found
under arms, irrespective of person, are to be shot
on sight. In future there will be no more exchange
of prisoners; on both sides, it is kill or be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By these cruel means he hoped to prejudice the
people against their sovereign, thereby furthering
his own ambitious schemes for becoming President
of Mexico himself, schemes which were destined
never to be realized, however.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Fruits of the New Government</span></h2>
<p>We have seen from the preceding chapters
what the state of affairs in Mexico was
when Maximilian assumed the government.
By the beginning of the second year of the
Empire matters had already materially changed.
Most of the country folk had returned to their farms,
and city merchants who dealt in agricultural implements
soon saw their stock disappear, and were
forced to order fresh supplies. This led to a steady
commercial intercourse with the United States which
greatly increased after the close of the Civil War.
In the Spring of 1865 the duties to Mexico from New
York alone amounted to 1,700,000 pesos in a single
week. Trade with the West Indies, South America,
and Europe was also extensive. Merchants who
at first had been obliged to purchase on credit,
owing to the prevailing lack of funds, were by
this time able to pay cash for goods. This was
certainly one good result of the new government,
as must have been recognized by all public-minded
Mexicans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>With the prospect of profit and an assured market,
trades and crafts also revived. Hundreds of youths,
who had been torn from their peaceful occupations
and forced to join the revolutionist bands, returned
to their apprenticeships. Channels of trade were
improved. A regular line of mail steamships was
established in the Gulf of Mexico, and intercourse
was resumed with all Pacific ports. Fine steamers
made monthly trips from San Francisco to La Paz,
Guaymas, and Mazatlan, and twice a month from
Guaymas to Acapulco. Construction was begun on
the railroad between Vera Cruz and the capital,
though it was afterward suspended. A telegraph
line was built from Mexico to San Luis Potosi. The
national finances were also much improved. Customs
receipts steadily increased and the mints coined
more dollars than ever before, though still bearing
the stamp of the Republic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>These were some of the happy results of the new
administration. That they were of but brief duration
was not the fault of the government nor yet of
the Emperor, but of Juarez who, still passing as
President, succeeded only too well in his schemes for
undermining the Empire.</p>
<p>With increasing prosperity came a revival of
various sports and amusements, of which the Mexican
people are naturally so fond. Early in the year
1865 most of the European ambassadors arrived
with their suites, and a series of splendid entertainments
followed at the imperial court. Later the
marriage of Marshal Bazaine to the seventeen-year-old
niece of General Lopez furnished occasion for
more festivities. These diversions, however, did
not cause the Emperor to slacken his labors for the
improvement of the country. On the third of March,
1865, he had the Empire divided into fifty departments
and revived the so-called &ldquo;Indian Council,&rdquo;
which had existed in the days of Spanish sovereignty,
placing at its head the advocate, Faustin Chimalpopoca,
a pure Aztec. The Indians still formed the
larger part of the population of Mexico in spite of
the efforts of the Republic to enslave and crush them.
Realizing the importance of this class of people,
Maximilian took the greatest interest in their protection
and welfare, while they in turn remained
loyal to him to the last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>On the tenth of April, 1865, the anniversary of
his acceptance of the crown, Maximilian published
an imperial statute declaring that, as a number of
provinces still remained hostile to the Empire, he
did not deem it wise as yet to introduce popular
representation, but promised to do so as soon as
the national disturbances were settled. Besides the
Guadeloupe order, revived in 1863, and the order
of the Mexican Eagle, founded in January, 1865, a
special order for women, that of San Carlos, was
instituted, April tenth, by the joint sovereigns. Another
important task was the reorganization of the
army. Most of the Mexican officers at that time
were quite useless and must be got rid of. To
replace these and furnish a supply of efficient native
officers, Maximilian opened the military school at
Chapultepec.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s Attitude</span></h2>
<p>When Maximilian ascended the throne of
Mexico, the Civil War was still raging in
the United States, and the White House
had no time to care for the affairs of its southern
neighbor. Although from the first the United States
had refused to recognize the Empire, its attitude had
been neutral rather than actually hostile, and Napoleon
was counting on an indefinite continuation of
the war for the furtherance of his plans. The end
came sooner than was expected, however. After a
bitter struggle the Southern States yielded to the
North, and this materially changed the situation in
Mexico. Juarez was now not only regarded as
President, but furnished with active support, without
which he would doubtless have been forced to
give up the struggle. He hovered on the border,
now on one side of the line, now on the other, escaping
into Texas when the enemy was close at his
heels, and remaining there in safety until the danger
was passed, then crossing back into Mexico again,
where, reinforced by volunteers from the north, he
won frequent victories over the imperial troops and
constantly gained ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s position was likewise changed. In a
speech delivered from the throne on the twenty-second
of January, 1866, he declared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Mexico the government founded by the
people continues to thrive. The rebels, overpowered
and dispersed, have no longer any leaders.
The national troops have proved their valor and the
country has furnished security for order and safety
in the development of resources which have made
its commerce worth millions with France alone.
Our enterprise therefore is progressing most successfully,
as I last year expressed the hope that it would.
As to the recall of our troops I have come to an
understanding with Emperor Maximilian, whereby
their withdrawal may be accomplished without
danger to the interests of France, for the protection
of which in that distant country we have pledged
ourselves. Any objections raised by the United
States to the continued presence of our troops in
Mexico will be removed, I feel sure, by the justice
of our explanations. The American people will
perceive that an enterprise in which we sought their
aid cannot be contrary to their interests. Two
nations, equally jealous of their rights, must naturally
resent any step that might jeopardize their
honor or their dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Plausible and reassuring as this sounds, it nevertheless
betrays two facts: France&rsquo;s fear of being
drawn into war with the United States if she continued
to maintain an army on American soil, and
Napoleon&rsquo;s desire to conciliate that country even at
the cost of violating the Treaty of Miramar. True,
there may have been something in the secret articles
added to this document which justified Napoleon&rsquo;s
methods, while on the other hand it is evident that
Maximilian was far from opposing the recall of
Bazaine, nor did he object to the gradual withdrawal
of the French troops, as may be seen from
the following announcement that appeared in the
<i>Monitor</i>:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;In pursuance to an agreement between M. Dano,
the French ambassador, His Excellency Marshal
Bazaine, and the Mexican government, the Emperor
has ordered that the French troops shall leave
Mexico in three detachments: the first to go in
November, 1866, the second in March, 1867, the
third in the following November. Negotiations
between the two governments have also begun to
substitute those articles of the Treaty of Miramar relating
to finance, new stipulations whereby France&rsquo;s
indebtedness and the interest of the loan guaranteed
by her to Mexico shall be assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The United States declared itself satisfied with
these assurances and continued to assist Juarez in
his attempts to undermine the government.</p>
<p>The year 1866, which thus began so peacefully on
paper at a time when there was little peace in
the air, either in Europe or America, was to prove
an eventful one for Maximilian, and hastened
with giant strides the downfall of the Mexican
Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress&rsquo; Journey to Europe</span></h2>
<p>On the seventh of July, 1866, the following
unexpected announcement appeared in one
of the Mexican journals: &ldquo;Her Majesty, the
Empress, leaves to-morrow for Europe, where she is
to arrange the settlement of various matters of
Mexican as well as international import. No greater
proof of patriotism and self-denial could be furnished
on the part of our sovereign than the assumption of
this mission, the more so as the Empress sails from
Vera Cruz, where yellow fever is so prevalent at this
season. We publish this in order that the people
may know the real purpose of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Empress Carlotta&rsquo;s sudden departure aroused
great excitement. It was generally felt, and not
without reason, that such a step must have been
due to weighty causes, the issue of which it was at
that time impossible to foresee. For Maximilian it
marked a turning-point in his career. It was as if
with the departure of his guardian angel, Fortune
too had forsaken him and abandoned him to his
fate.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="689" />
<p class="caption"><i>EMPRESS CARLOTTA</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Unexpectedly and most uncomfortably for Napoleon,
Carlotta arrived at St. Nazaire on the eighth
of August by the packet-boat, <i>Empress Eug&eacute;nie</i>. She
was met by the Mexican ambassador, Almonte, and
his wife, who travelled with her to Paris without
delay. Metternich, the Austrian ambassador, was
awaiting her at the Grand Hotel, and on the eleventh
of August she had a long interview with Napoleon
at St. Cloud. Accounts vary as to what actually
transpired on this memorable occasion, but according
to Hellwald, who seems a reliable authority,
three points were discussed. The first related to
the postponement of the withdrawal of the first
detachment of French troops from November, 1866,
to April, 1867, by which time Maximilian hoped to
have his own army so strengthened that he could
better spare the French. Juarez had been making
such headway in the north that the Emperor did
not dare as yet to dispense with his allies. Next
the Empress desired that Bazaine should be immediately
recalled and General Donay sent out in his
place, a request not difficult to understand considering
the many differences that had occurred between
Maximilian and the Marshal. The third point concerned
Mexico&rsquo;s ever empty exchequer. By the
Treaty of Miramar Mexico had agreed to repay her
financial obligations to France; but, as we have seen,
she was by no means able to pay her debts or even
the interest on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>In her first interview the Empress accomplished
nothing. Napoleon was unwilling to defer the withdrawal
of his troops for some months, for fear of
giving offence to the government at Washington.
As to the second point no agreement was arrived at,
for Bazaine was not recalled. When he did leave
Mexico at last, he not only took the entire army
with him, but also induced the volunteers from
Austria and Belgium to resign. As to a settlement
of the Mexican debt, however, a separate treaty was
concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>On the twenty-second of August Empress Eug&eacute;nie
and Emperor Napoleon made a final visit to Empress
Carlotta, who left Paris on the following day for
Brussels. From there she went to Italy, and on the
twenty-ninth arrived once more at Miramar where
she had spent so many happy days. Another task
now awaited her. As the negotiations between
Maximilian&rsquo;s ministry and the papal nuncio concerning
the religious situation in Mexico had been
unsuccessful, Carlotta determined to try and settle
the affair herself. On the twenty-fifth of September,
therefore, she arrived again in Rome with
her suite and two days later had a long audience
with the Pope. Soon after this she was suddenly
taken ill. At first her attack was said to be only
the result of the fatigues of her long journey and the
change of climate, an explanation which seemed
sufficiently plausible. The real nature of the illness
could not be long concealed, however. The Empress&rsquo;
mind had become totally deranged, and her
malady was later pronounced incurable. Shocked
as all Europe was by this dreadful news, what must
have been its effect upon Maximilian! How he
received it, is told as follows by his own physician,
Dr. Basch:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor at this time was living entirely
secluded in the palace, only Herzfeld, the Minister
of State, Father Fischer, the court chaplain, and
myself being present at his table. There were no
invited guests till the eighteenth of August, for the
afternoon of which a large dinner was planned.
That morning the Emperor held a council of state,
at the close of which I entered the imperial cabinet.
While I was present, two cable despatches
arrived from Europe, at sight of which His Majesty
was visibly alarmed. His forebodings were well
founded. The first was sent by Castello from
Rome on the fifth of October, and read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Her Majesty, the Empress, has succumbed to
the fatigues and difficulties of her mission, and must
be taken to Miramar without delay, accompanied
by her physicians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other, dated the twelfth, was from Count
Bombelles at Miramar, and contained the further
information that all hope was not yet abandoned.
Her Majesty, with her entire suite, was at Miramar,
and a member of the household would follow at
once with advices. Herzfeld opened the despatches
and, unwilling to break their contents too suddenly
to the Emperor, pretended that he was unable to
decipher them exactly, but reassured His Majesty
by asserting that the news apparently referred to
the illness of some one at Miramar, probably one of
the Empress&rsquo; ladies-in-waiting, Madame Bario, who
was a Mexican.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;The facts could not long be concealed, however,
for the Emperor, suspecting that something was
being withheld from him, insisted upon knowing the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I feel that something terrible has happened,&rsquo; he
declared. &lsquo;Tell me what it is, for I am consumed
with anxiety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Herzfeld was seemingly studying the
despatches more closely, I retired to my apartment,
but was soon summoned again by His Majesty. As
I entered, he turned to me, tears streaming down
his cheeks, and asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know who Dr. Riedel is in Vienna?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the mention of this name, the truth flashed
upon me. Herzfeld had disclosed the news, and
much as I longed to spare the Emperor, I could not
lie to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is the director of the Insane Asylum,&rsquo; I was
reluctantly forced to reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These melancholy tidings only served to hasten
the impending crisis. Already disheartened by
repeated trials and disappointments, Maximilian
now saw his last hope vanish, and felt himself deserted
by Providence. Indifferent to all that passed,
his only thought seemed to be of hastening to his
beloved wife and leaving behind him this ill-fated
country to which she had been so cruelly sacrificed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Events in Mexico after the Departure of the Empress</span></h2>
<p>Two persons have already been mentioned who
played an important part in the events of
this history, Herzfeld, the Minister of State,
and Father Fischer. Herzfeld was a German and
devoted to the Emperor. Unfortunately Maximilian
sent him back to Europe soon after this,
thereby depriving himself of a valuable friend and
adviser in his days of misfortune. Father Fischer
was born in W&uuml;rtemberg, of Protestant parents, and
seems to have had rather an adventurous career.
He came to America with a band of emigrants who
settled in Texas, and went from there to California as
a gold miner. Becoming a convert to Catholicism,
he entered the Jesuit order, from which he was subsequently
dismissed, for good and sufficient reasons,
no doubt. The description of this man given by
the Emperor&rsquo;s physician is far from flattering, but
it is manifestly unjust to lay his faults at the door
of the much-abused order of Jesuits. A whole
society cannot be held responsible for the deeds or
misdeeds of a single member, still less when that
member has ceased to be one. At all events Father
Fischer belonged to the Emperor&rsquo;s closest circle of
friends, another member of which was Professor
Bilimek, whose acquaintance we shall make in the
next chapter. This man was a scholar, absorbed in
the study of the flowers and butterflies of Mexico
and troubling himself little with political affairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>After the departure of the Empress matters went
rapidly from bad to worse. In the north the followers
of Juarez had inflicted a series of defeats on the
imperial troops and were steadily gaining ground,
while in the capital the outlook was far from encouraging.
Maximilian had replaced two of his Mexican
ministers with Frenchmen, Generals Osmont and
Friant, but their attempts to remedy the situation
were frustrated by the pride and jealousy of the
Mexicans who bitterly resented the appointment of
foreigners to these high positions. The United
States, moreover, took exceptions to these appointments
as a violation of French neutrality and made
a formal complaint to Napoleon, whereupon the
following announcement appeared in the <i>Monitor</i>:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the twenty-sixth of July His Majesty, the
Emperor of Mexico, issued a decree entrusting the
portfolio of war to General Osmont, Chief of Staff
of the Expedition Corps, and that of finance to
Friant, intendant-general of the army. As, however,
the military duties of these gentlemen, both
holding important posts in an army still in the
field, are irreconcilable with the responsibilities of
their new positions, they have received no authorization
to accept these appointments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plainly shows France&rsquo;s fear of the United
States and her indifference to her engagements with
Maximilian. A new ministry, therefore, had to be
formed, in the selection of which Father Fischer&rsquo;s
influence is said to have been largely responsible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>As the prospects for a restoration of the Republic
grew brighter, Juarez did not remain the only candidate
for the presidential chair, a certain Ortega
and the former ex-President Santa Anna also appearing
as aspirants to the honor. The position of
the imperial forces on the border soon became so
unsafe that Maximilian was forced to abandon those
districts to the revolutionists and withdraw his
troops more into the interior. Even his attempt
to keep the way to the coast open was not successful,
for the city of Xalapa, on the road to Vera Cruz,
was besieged and captured by the rebels, thus cutting
off communication between the capital and the
coast, while many of the native soldiers deserted
and went over to the enemy with their leaders.
Even among the revolutionists, however, there were
dissensions, the greater part of them supporting
Juarez, others Ortega or Santa Anna. On one point
only were they united, the downfall of the Empire
and restoration of the Republic.</p>
<p>Another incident occurred at this time which was
well calculated to make Maximilian, already suffering
from an intermittent fever, caused by the climate,
still more averse to remaining in Mexico. This was
a conspiracy against his life, discovered by one of
the town prefects. The plot, hatched by some of
Santa Anna&rsquo;s guerilla followers, was to include the
murder of the prefect himself by his secretary, a
man from the lower classes whom he had befriended,
to be followed by that of several other prominent
personages. A closer investigation revealed that
the Emperor&rsquo;s life also had been aimed at.</p>
<p>Such were the people by whom Maximilian was
surrounded, and such the treachery which he had
constantly to deal with in his adopted country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>On the afternoon of the day on which the two
fatal despatches arrived in Mexico Maximilian was
taking his usual stroll on the flat roof of the palace
with his physician, when he suddenly announced his
intention of abandoning the country where he had
met with such ingratitude, and asked his friend&rsquo;s
advice as to the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see how it will be possible for Your
Majesty to remain here,&rdquo; replied the doctor frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be attributed to the Empress&rsquo; illness if
I should leave?&rdquo; he then inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is reason enough,&rdquo; returned the
other. &ldquo;Besides, Europe must recognize that Your
Majesty is no longer bound to remain in Mexico
after France&rsquo;s violation of her contracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose Herzfeld and Fischer will
think of it?&rdquo; continued Maximilian, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that Herzfeld will share my views,&rdquo;
declared the physician. &ldquo;As to Father Fischer, to
tell the truth, I have not much confidence in his
opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>They then discussed the advisability of leaving
at once or whether it would be better to wait
for a time, but as there seemed no good reason at
present for a sudden departure, Dr. Basch advised
deferring it for a week in order that suitable
preparations might be made.</p>
<p>That evening Maximilian summoned his Minister
of State and Professor Bilimek, director of the museum,
and laid the matter before them. To both,
the Emperor&rsquo;s safety was of far more concern than
the fate of a half-civilized country whose indifference
had caused the downfall of all his hopes and
schemes. The recent plot against the Emperor&rsquo;s
life also may well have been an argument in favor
of the plan. At all events they heartily coincided
with it and Herzfeld urged preparations for departure
with such energy that in three days&rsquo; time it was
possible to leave Chapultepec, a summer palace
near the city of Mexico, which Maximilian had had
newly restored and fitted up at great cost and where
he was staying at this time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The rumor of the Emperor&rsquo;s proposed departure
caused general consternation. The new ministry
was stunned and tried every means to dissuade him
from this step. But Maximilian remained deaf to
all arguments and, lest his resolution should be
weakened, Dr. Basch had orders to permit no one
to enter the royal apartments. All who came were
dismissed with the information that His Majesty
was ill and could receive no visitors. Even the
Princess Iturbide, aunt of little Prince Iturbide, a
descendant of August the First, the first Emperor of
Mexico, whom Maximilian, having no children of
his own, had named as Crown Prince, was unable
to gain access to him. The physician admits he had
rather a violent scene with the high-spirited Princess.
She would take no denial and ended by
roundly abusing those friends of the Emperor&rsquo;s who
had persuaded him to leave Mexico.</p>
<p>As a last resort the ministry threatened to resign
in a body if the plan were persisted in, but even
this was of no avail. Maximilian quietly declared
that if these gentlemen resigned their offices he
would leave the country at once, and he would
certainly have kept his word. It is greatly to be
regretted, therefore, that they did not do so and
thus spare Mexico the everlasting stain of treachery
and murder. Finding it the only means of at least
deferring the Emperor&rsquo;s abdication, however, they
remained at their posts and sent a message to him
agreeing to carry on the business of government
during his absence in accordance with his wishes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Maximilian had already received a letter from
Bazaine approving the plan of changing his residence
to Orizaba, which was only a day&rsquo;s journey
from the seaport of Vera Cruz, and promising to
maintain law and order in the capital. The Emperor&rsquo;s
abdication would suit his own plans very
well, by bringing him a step nearer to the realization
of his secret ambitions.</p>
<p>Thanks to Herzfeld&rsquo;s energy and activity, all was
ready at the appointed time, and at four o&rsquo;clock on
the morning of the twenty-first of October, the
Emperor, escorted by a troop of three hundred
hussars under the command of Colonel Kodolitsch,
set out from Chapultepec, little thinking ever to see
that place again. Councillor Herzfeld remained in
the capital to arrange some business matters, expecting
to join the Emperor later on.</p>
<p>The journey to Orizaba must not be passed over
in silence, as it was marked by the occurrence of
an important event. On the afternoon of the first
day, the imperial party reached the Hacienda
Socyapan, where they were to spend the night. The
Emperor seemed abstracted, and walked up and
down before the <i>hacienda</i> in silence with his physician
and Professor Bilimek. At length he broke
out suddenly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot have any more bloodshed in this
unhappy country on my account. What am I to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor advised him to abdicate and sail for
Europe at once, but Dr. Basch opposed this, representing
that an unnecessarily sudden departure would
only precipitate matters and bring about exactly
what the Emperor wished to avoid, namely, more
bloodshed in Mexico. At the same time he urged a
revocation of the decree of the third of October,
1865, a suggestion which Maximilian cordially
approved, and in regard to which he expressed himself
in strong terms on this occasion.</p>
<p>Father Fischer and Colonel Kodolitsch, who were
also in the Emperor&rsquo;s confidence, added their influence
to the doctor&rsquo;s, urging that a <i>hacienda</i> was not
a suitable place from which to abdicate a throne, as
Maximilian himself was forced to acknowledge. He
contented himself, therefore, with issuing two orders.
Father Fischer was to write personal letters at once
to Bazaine and to Minister Lares, ordering the repeal
of the law of the third of October and the cessation
of all hostilities until further notice. These two
important despatches were entrusted to Count
Lamotte, an officer in the Austrian Hussars, to carry
back to the city of Mexico, and on the following
morning the Emperor left the <i>hacienda</i> apparently
much relieved. At noon of the second day, while
resting at Rio-Frio, he sent the following telegram
to Captain Pierron:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;You, with Messieurs Pino, Trouchot, and Mangino,
are hereby appointed a commission which,
under your direction and with the assistance of
some trustworthy official from the ministry of
finance, will examine the Civil List accounts, mine
as well as that of the Empress, to prove whether we
owe the State or the State us. I desire from the
commission a detailed and authenticated statement
in regard to this, in which shall be included the sum
taken by the Empress for her voyage to Europe,
and that received by my secretary on the Civil List
account, together with those employed by Minister
Arroyo after the reduction of the Civil List, in
works on the palace and at Chapultepec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herzfeld was also commissioned to issue, in the
name of the Emperor, the necessary written orders
to the prefect and treasurer at Miramar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor wishes the utmost publicity to be
given these matters,&rdquo; so Herzfeld was notified, &ldquo;and
holds you responsible therefor on your honor and
your friendship. Amid the political shipwreck he
desires to keep his name and honor untarnished and
would rather suffer personal loss than touch any
part of the property of the Mexican nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the stations of Actzingo and Canada, Maximilian
spent the night in the house of the priests, a
fact which furnished his enemies an opportunity for
accusing him of too close affiliation with the clergy.
His arrival was everywhere hailed with rejoicings,
and he was overwhelmed with expressions of sympathy
for the illness of the Empress. On the twenty-seventh
of October the imperial party reached the
city of Orizaba, which they entered at five o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon, greeted with booming of cannon
and the enthusiastic acclamations of the populace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Emperor at Orizaba</span></h2>
<p>Herzfeld&rsquo;s knowledge of the real state of
affairs and anxiety for his master&rsquo;s safety
soon caused him to lay aside all other considerations
and follow the Emperor to Orizaba,
where he urged preparations for departure with all
possible despatch. In the midst of those, however,
he was ordered to Europe by Maximilian to prepare
for his arrival there. Thus this loyal friend was
spared being a witness of the Emperor&rsquo;s tragic fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>During his stay in Orizaba Maximilian led a
simple, secluded life in his palace, seeing only his
intimate associates, but occupied with arrangements
for departure, and the settling of his private affairs.
Much to his satisfaction, his Civil List showed a
balance in his favor of $180,000. All his servants
but two were paid and dismissed. Colonel Kodolitsch
was sent to Mexico to arrange with Bazaine
concerning the Austrian and Belgian volunteers,
who had followed Maximilian to Mexico and for
whose future he felt it his duty to provide. One
question much discussed confidentially, and which
Maximilian seemed quite unable to decide, was as to
whether the abdication should take place before his
departure or in Europe, where he had accepted the
crown. His plans for the future were already made.
It was not his intention to return at once to Austria,
but to travel for two years, meeting the Empress at
Corfu, if her condition should permit. Meanwhile
his own health had greatly improved. With his two
countrymen, Dr. Basch and Professor Bilimek, he
made frequent excursions about the neighborhood,
enjoying the wonderful scenery or searching for rare
specimens of plants and insects. Suddenly, however,
events occurred which changed the aspect of
affairs and effectually put an end to the Emperor&rsquo;s
plans of travel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Two old comrades-in-arms in the Mexican army,
Generals Marquez and Miramon, returned from
Europe and, seeking an immediate audience with the
Emperor, urged him to return to the capital, holding
out promises of support and encouraging prospects
for the imperial cause. While Maximilian was hesitating,
a letter arrived from Bazaine, which turned
the scale. In this the Marshal was so imprudent as
to tell tales out of school, betraying the fact that
Napoleon III had made other plans for Mexico
without consulting Maximilian, who, as he had not
yet abdicated, was still sovereign of the country.
This arbitrary conduct on the part of his ally roused
Maximilian to action. Indignant at the slight cast
upon him and anxious to prove that he was not
slinking away at the bidding of France like a disgraced
servant, he was in a proper frame of mind to
respond to the appeal made by his conservative
advisers, that it was his duty to remain and not
desert his party in the hour of danger. Although
outwardly preparations for departure continued as
before, the Emperor&rsquo;s resolution was weakened,
and toward the end of November he summoned his
council to Orizaba to consult with them as to the
advisability of his abdication, giving in an address
to that body his reasons for such a step, <i>viz.</i>, the
spread of the revolution with its attendant evils, the
hostility of the United States toward Mexico, and
the withdrawal of the support of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>A vote was taken, twenty-three members of the
council being present, of whom two were for immediate
abdication, ten of the opposite opinion, while
eleven were in favor of abdication, but held that the
present was not the time for such a step. Maximilian
yielded to the majority and agreed to remain
on condition that funds should be raised for the
proper defence of the government and the organization
of a permanent national army, and that
measures should be taken toward the settlement
of questions pending with France and the United
States. The Mexicans, proverbially lavish with
promises, readily agreed to all these points, and on
the first of December the Emperor issued a manifesto
to the people, declaring that he had yielded
to the desire of his council on condition that a congress
representing all parties should be summoned
to decide the existence of the Empire, and, if this
were confirmed, he would devote himself to the
promotion of its welfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>On the twelfth of December, 1866, Maximilian
left Orizaba to return to Mexico, accompanied by
most of the members of the council who, in the
unsettled condition of the country, were glad to
avail themselves of the imperial escort, consisting
as before of Colonel Kodolitsch&rsquo;s hussars. They
consumed much time on the journey, lingering for
nearly three weeks at Puebla, Maximilian residing
at first in the Xonaca palace, a short distance
outside the city. Here he held an interview with
Castelnan, the French consul, which appears to
have been of a most unpleasant nature and widened
still further the breach between the two Emperors.
Scientific expeditions were also attempted by the
three friends, as at Orizaba, but, finding few specimens
in the region about Puebla, these excursions
were soon abandoned and Maximilian moved his
residence into the city.</p>
<p>Arriving in Mexico on the fifth of January, 1867,
Maximilian remained for a time at the Hacienda de
Teja, a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s distance from the
capital. While there three of his former ministers,
Ramirez, Escudero, and Robles y Pezuela, made a
final attempt to induce him to abdicate and leave
the country at once. But although evidently impressed
by their arguments he refused to follow their
advice. The accusations of vacillation and irresolution
afterward made against Maximilian would seem
to be justified by his behavior at this time. Doubtful
of himself and of the future, he still clung to the
hope of being able at least to retire with honor, conscious
of having fulfilled his duty to his adherents.
In relating to his physician the interview with his
ex-ministers, he declared that Ramirez wept at
parting, expressing the earnest wish that his evil
forebodings might not be realized. He knew but
too well how deceptive were the promises of his
countrymen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;In no case,&rdquo; continued the Emperor, &ldquo;will I
remain here more than a few months, only until
affairs are more settled. Will it injure my health,
do you think, to stay on in Mexico? Will the fever
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no anxiety as to Your Majesty&rsquo;s health
on that score,&rdquo; replied the physician; &ldquo;it is Your
Majesty&rsquo;s life I fear for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maximilian&rsquo;s attempts to convoke an assembly of
liberal representatives from all parties to discuss
measures for remedying the existing disorders in the
country met with small success, as might have been
expected. It seemed impossible to obtain any sort
of peaceful fusion or co&ouml;peration, and there was
nothing left for the Junta (congress) but to declare
war on the rebels in Mexico&mdash;war to the knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Departure of the French</span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile the French were making active
preparations for their return to France.
On the sixteenth of January, 1867, a letter
arrived from Napoleon Third, revoking the extraordinary
powers granted to Bazaine as commander-in-chief
of the Expedition Corps and declaring the corps
itself disbanded. The embarkation of the first
division of troops on the <i>Empress Eug&eacute;nie</i> had then
already begun. This was in accordance with the
secret articles already mentioned, and met with no
objection on the part of Maximilian. The recall of
the foreign legion, however, included in the order,
was a direct violation of the Treaty of Miramar,
which guaranteed their remaining in the country
for several years yet, if needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>In February the French marched out of the capital.
Before leaving they burned as many of the
army effects as could not profitably be taken with
them. A large quantity of powder was poured into
the water, and projectiles were rendered useless by
being filled with sand, so that the Mexicans should
not profit by their possession. It is hard to believe
that Bazaine&rsquo;s personal feeling could have gone to
such lengths, but there seems no reason to doubt the
truth of these statements. During the Russian retreat
before the French, in 1812, stores of all kinds
were destroyed to prevent their falling into the
enemy&rsquo;s hands. Maximilian was not yet an enemy;
on the contrary, he was supposed to be an ally, yet
for days huge columns of fire and smoke testified to
the friendship of the French.</p>
<p>Nor was this all. On the occasion of the Marshal&rsquo;s
marriage to his Mexican wife, Maximilian had
presented him with a palace, which in case of his
recall was to be redeemed by the government for
150,000 piastres ($100,000). Now that he was
about to leave the country forever he demanded the
promised sum, though well aware of the state of
Mexican finances, and, finding it impossible to
obtain the money from an empty exchequer, sold
enough French arms and ammunition to the revolutionists
at insignificant prices to make up the amount.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>When Bazaine, some months before, had begun
the reorganization of the Mexican army which was
to replace the French, he had ordered that all commanders
must be Frenchmen, other officers and
privates either French or Mexicans; pay, equipment,
etc., to be the same as in the French army, and those
of his own troops who chose were to be free to remain
in the service of the Emperor. Yet in spite of this,
before the departure of the last of the troops in
February, 1867, he issued an order declaring that all
French soldiers, officers or privates, who did not
return to their own banner immediately would be
regarded as deserters and forfeit all rights as citizens.
Owing to the wide area of country involved
and the difficulty of communication it was, of course,
impossible for this order to reach all the French
soldiers in Mexico&mdash;a fact which was taken advantage
of later by Juarez, for all the Frenchmen serving
under Maximilian, who were unfortunate enough to
be taken prisoners, were shot as deserters. Before
leaving, however, the Marshal was kind enough to
send a message to Maximilian, offering to wait for
him in case he should decide to leave the country&mdash;an
offer which, needless to say, was declined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>With the French troops, thanks to Bazaine&rsquo;s
powers of persuasion, went the greater part of the
Austrian and Belgian volunteers, who had done
distinguished service under the command of Count
Thun, only a few of the Austrians remaining with
their Prince. The first step now to be taken was
the formation of the new national army, a task
already begun by Bazaine. Maximilian divided it,
roughly speaking, into three corps, commanded
respectively by Generals Miramon, Marquez, and
Mejia. As these three men are henceforth to play
an important part in Mexican affairs, a word concerning
them may not be amiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Miramon had already enjoyed the honor of occupying
the presidential chair in Mexico, at which
time Marquez had served under him. One incident
will suffice to illustrate the character of these two
heroes. After the capture of Tacubaya, in 1859,
they made a visit to the hospital where a corps of
seven surgeons were caring for the wounded, friend
and foe alike. That very day Miramon issued an
order to Marquez, requiring all prisoners ranking
from subalterns to staff-officers to be shot under
his personal supervision&mdash;a list of the same to be
delivered to himself that evening. And Leonardo
Marquez, this worthy henchman, carried out these
instructions so faithfully that not only every prisoner
was shot before sunset, but also the surgeons
of whom there had been no mention in the order.
Such were the ideas of justice that animated these
two commanders of the Mexican national army, yet
Marquez, in particular, seems to have completely
succeeded in concealing his real character from
Maximilian, over whom he unfortunately had great
influence. In marked contrast to these was the
Indian Mejia, who, though still young and of unprepossessing
appearance, was brave and honest, a
good soldier, and loyal to the end to his imperial
master, whose death indeed he shared.</p>
<p>Army corps, properly speaking, were out of the
question, of course, in the Mexican army, of which
only the few remaining French troops and foreign
volunteers were trained soldiers. For the rest and
for the greater part it was composed of half-hearted
Mexicans, impressed into the service and ready to
go over to the enemy at a moment&rsquo;s notice whenever
it pleased them. Of the volunteers Colonel
Kherenh&uuml;ller had succeeded in forming a regiment
of hussars, and Baron Hammerstein, one of infantry,
while Count Wickenburg had an auxiliary force of
constabulary, and Colonel Masso the <i>cazadores</i> or
<i>chasseurs</i>, all of whom did good service. That
their blood was shed in vain, that they never had
the honor of fighting near the Emperor or defending
him with their lives, was not the fault of
these brave Germans, but of the traitorous villain
Marquez.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Maximilian next divided the country into three
great military districts. Mejia was given command
in the east, with headquarters at San Luis Potosi,
Miramon was stationed in the west at Quer&eacute;taro,
while Marquez, controlling the central district,
remained in the capital.</p>
<p>The Emperor was determined now to show that
he could maintain his position without the aid of
French bayonets&mdash;a proof of confidence and fearlessness
which was hailed with acclamations by the
imperialists, who already foresaw the downfall of
Juarez and the triumph of the Empire. Before
actual hostilities began, however, Maximilian made
one more effort to avert bloodshed and make peace
with his enemies. But it was all in vain. His
overtures were coldly rejected and there was nothing
for it but to let fate take its course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The first advance was made by Miramon, who
succeeded in inflicting a severe defeat upon the
republicans, Juarez and his ministers only escaping
by the swiftness of their horses. But the exultation
caused by this news soon gave place to deepest
dejection. Some days later, Escobedo, commander
of the revolutionist army in the north, surprised the
imperialists at San Jacinto and put them to rout,
while Miramon, with the remnants of his scattered
forces, took refuge in Quer&eacute;taro.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Siege of Quer&eacute;taro</span></h2>
<p>On the tenth of February the Emperor told
his physician to prepare for a two weeks&rsquo;
expedition to Quer&eacute;taro. Prompted by the
urgent representations of his ministers, Lares and
Marquez, that his presence was needed there to
counteract the demoralizing effect of Miramon&rsquo;s
defeat, he determined to place himself at the head
of the army. After some delay, owing to the difficulty
of obtaining funds for the campaign, in spite
of the ministry&rsquo;s assurances as to the satisfactory
condition of the national finances, Maximilian set
out upon this fateful journey on the thirteenth of
February, with a force of sixteen hundred Mexicans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The matter had been arranged with so much
secrecy that even Prince Salm and Major Hammerstein
had no suspicion of the plan, while the Austrian
hussars were dumbfounded when they found the
Emperor starting for Quer&eacute;taro without them. Two
men have been accused of persuading Maximilian to
this rash and fatal step&mdash;Father Fischer and the
Prussian ambassador, Baron Magnus. Dr. Basch,
one of the few who were in the secret, denies this,
however, and places the blame entirely on the two
ministers, Lares and Marquez&mdash;the latter of whom
had managed to win the Emperor&rsquo;s entire confidence
by his eloquence and flattery. This seems the more
probable since it was to their interest to remove
Maximilian to a safe distance. Once already he
had started for the coast. Why might he not do
so again and with the aid of his Austrians succeed in
reaching it and bidding adieu to the country forever?
This must be prevented at all cost. As for leaving
these loyal troops behind and trusting himself to
the uncertain Mexicans, it must be remembered that
Maximilian was completely deceived as to the real
state of affairs. From his order to Dr. Basch it is
evident he expected to return from Quer&eacute;taro in a
short time. He wished also to give his Mexican
subjects a proof of his confidence in them, a noble
and chivalrous idea, no doubt, but most imprudent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Marquez, on the other hand, was anxious to keep
the Emperor under his own influence and away
from that of his German friends, whose advice
might seriously interfere with his plans. It was also
important to leave the capital in safe hands, and no
one realized more than Marquez the difference between
the Austrian troops and his ragged Mexican
soldiers, many of them wearing a uniform for the
first time.</p>
<p>It was doubtless for this reason that the plan was
kept so secret. The Emperor&rsquo;s friends would surely
have dissuaded him from taking such a step or, at
least, have insisted on accompanying him. Indeed,
when Kherenh&uuml;ller and Hammerstein heard that
he was about to leave for Quer&eacute;taro, they tried their
best to induce him to take them with him. As a
last resort they even appealed to Father Fischer to
use his influence in their behalf, but all in vain.
Having promised his friend, Marquez, Maximilian
felt he could not in honor retract his word.</p>
<p>Shortly before setting out he took leave of his
Austrian officers, assuring them that his reasons for
taking this journey were purely political ones, and
promising that they should soon follow. Prince
Salm indeed did follow with a few trusted men,
in spite of the Emperor&rsquo;s prohibition, overtaking the
imperial party before they reached Quer&eacute;taro. Of
the march thither Maximilian himself gives an interesting
account in a letter to Professor Bilimek who
had returned to Miramar some time before. In it
he writes:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you will already have learned through the
newspapers, our friends, the French, have at last
left Mexico, and, having once more obtained liberty
of action, we have exchanged the butterfly net for
the sword. Instead of bugs and beetles we now
pursue other game. Bullets instead of bees now
buzz about our heads. Twice between Mexico and
Quer&eacute;taro we were in action and had a number of
our men killed and wounded. One of the latter fell
just in front of my horse and was immediately
operated on, under fire, by Dr. Basch, the only
European who accompanied me. In the second
skirmish, where we were shot at like targets, our
Hungarian cook (you remember him?), who was
riding behind us with our servant Grill, was wounded
on the lip. In every town where there were no
revolutionists we were welcomed most heartily by
the people, whom we found longing for peace and
cursing the French.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Maximilian reached Quer&eacute;taro on the nineteenth
and was received with the enthusiasm to be expected
from one of the strongest imperialist cities. The
streets were thronged with curious spectators who
hailed the Emperor&rsquo;s appearance with shouts of joy,
while from windows and balconies, flags and gay
hangings of all sorts waved a welcome. The Spanish
casino had been selected and prepared as a residence
for the Emperor, where he was received by the commandant
of the city, General Escobar, after which
the whole party attended a solemn Te Deum at the
cathedral.</p>
<p>In the evening there were great festivities, concluding
with a magnificent banquet, at which there
was no lack of those fine speeches wherein the
Mexicans especially excel. Maximilian took no
part in these celebrations, pleading fatigue as an
excuse. Marquez, however, improved the occasion
rudely to impress upon General Miramon the sense
of their altered positions, he now being commander-in-chief
and Miramon his inferior, at the same time
openly displaying his satisfaction over the latter&rsquo;s
recent defeat. Truly a noble soul! Although white
with rage, Miramon controlled himself, replying
briefly with a toast to the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>For a time after his arrival in Quer&eacute;taro, Maximilian
found the life very pleasant. His simple,
kindly ways soon won the hearts of the people, with
whom he mingled freely and fearlessly, joining in
their amusements and conversing familiarly with all
classes. His coolness under fire also roused the
admiration of his soldiers, who cheered wildly as he
rode calmly past their ranks, the enemy&rsquo;s bullets
whistling about his head.</p>
<p>In the capital, meanwhile, there was so little
thought given to the Emperor and his companions
in Quer&eacute;taro, and there was so little idea of keeping
any of the promises made to him, it would almost
seem that Marquez was not the only traitor. Soon
after leaving Mexico, Maximilian had sent back
word for the Austrian troops remaining there to
follow him at once. Had this order been delivered,
the expedition to Quer&eacute;taro might have had a
different and less tragic ending. But, owing to
Marquez, it never reached its destination, and the
Emperor&rsquo;s loyal friends, Kherenh&uuml;ller and Hammerstein,
were prevented from joining him while there
was still time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The city of Quer&eacute;taro had at this time a population
of some forty thousand inhabitants. It lay in
a narrow valley on the southern bank of a small
stream, called the Rio Blanco, forming a quadrangle
of about eight thousand feet in length by four thousand
in breadth. To the west extended a wide
plain, called from the mountains behind it the plain
of Guadalajara, while running from south to northeast
was a range of hills, afterward utilized by the
republicans with great effect. Two places which
proved of special importance to the imperialists
during the siege were the Cerro de la Campa&ntilde;a, a
hill lying just west of the city, and the Convent de
la Cruz, almost at the opposite end. This was a
large stone edifice of great strength, dating from the
days of Cortez. The convent grounds were enclosed
by heavy stone walls, and had at the eastern end a
smaller but equally strong building known as the
Pantheon or burial-place of the convent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Two weeks after the Emperor&rsquo;s arrival (March
fifth), the republican forces, under General Escobedo,
appeared before Quer&eacute;taro and began to invest
the town. The garrison consisted of about four
thousand infantry, three thousand cavalry, and had
forty-four cannon&mdash;a force so insignificant, compared
with the vast armies of the present day, that it
is remarkable it should have held out as long as it
did against such overwhelming superiority of numbers.
General Mejia had arrived at Quer&eacute;taro
shortly before this, with his troops from Potosi,
among whom were a number of German officers and
soldiers, while serving under Miramon were some
six hundred Frenchmen. Immediately after the
appearance of the enemy, Maximilian held a council
of war with his generals. Miramon and Mejia were
in favor of attacking the republicans before their
forces should have time to unite&mdash;an excellent plan
which was not carried out owing to the opposition
of the all-influential Marquez, who held that the
defence of the city should be their first consideration.
Thus precious time was allowed to pass, and the
imperialists looked calmly on while the enemy
gradually crowned the surrounding heights with
batteries. The Emperor had first established his
headquarters on the Cerro de la Campa&ntilde;a, but when
the republicans extended their lines eastward, they
were moved to the Convent de la Cruz (so called
from a cross erected there in commemoration of the
conquest). General Miramon now occupied the
former headquarters with a battery of eight guns,
while the chief defence of the town was entrusted to
the Mexican Castillo, an able general, but no longer
young and almost entirely deaf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The enemy&rsquo;s next move was to cut off the city&rsquo;s
supplies, both of water and provisions, hoping to
subdue it by starvation. The only water now obtainable
was that of the Rio Blanco, while meat soon
grew so scarce that many of the cavalry horses had
to be sacrificed. Juarez himself joined the republican
camp for a time, but, being unable to endure
the smell of powder, soon returned to Potosi. On the
fourteenth of March the Juarists made their first
general attack on the town, assaults being made on
three sides at once, under cover of the batteries.
The main struggle, however, took place at La Cruz.
After a hot fight they succeeded in capturing the
Pantheon, but were afterward driven out by a body
of Austrians. During the attack Maximilian remained
in the great square before the convent,
exposed to the hottest fire, yet quite calm and
apparently unconscious of the deadly hail of bullets
all about him. Once a shell burst only a few paces
in front of him, but fortunately no one was injured,
though an adjutant had his sword bent and his
clothes burned by a flying splinter. Prince Salm,
always conspicuous for bravery, made a brilliant
sortie and succeeded in capturing the first guns from
the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>By evening the Juarists had been repulsed at all
points and driven back, but the victory proved
barren in results. Lopez, for some reason, took no
part in the action, while Marquez either would not
or did not know how to follow up the advantage
he had gained. As for Miramon, he distinguished
himself a few days later. It had been planned to
surprise the Juarists early on the morning of the
sixteenth, and Miramon was chosen to lead the
attack, from which great things were hoped. But
the whole scheme fell through because&mdash;that general
overslept!&mdash;a neglect of duty difficult to understand
in these days. When he did at last awake it
was broad daylight, and all thought of a surprise
had to be abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>On the twenty-first of March another council was
held and an important decision arrived at. This
was to send one of the generals back to the city of
Mexico with full authority from the Emperor to act
as he thought best. He was to dismiss the present
ministry and form a new one, to obtain more funds,
and, in any case, to return with aid to Quer&eacute;taro without
delay. Marquez, for whom the place was getting
much too warm by this time, had no difficulty
in obtaining the appointment&mdash;a simple means of
escaping the trap into which he had led his sovereign.
Still trusting the traitor implicitly, Maximilian left
it entirely to him whether to bring only a part of
the troops from Mexico or the whole garrison. It
was arranged that Marquez, with one thousand
horsemen, was to make his way through the hills to
the south, while Miramon, to divert the enemy&rsquo;s
attention, made a sortie in the opposite direction.
The plan was kept so secret that even Miramon had
no suspicion of the real purpose of his expedition.
This time he did not oversleep but successfully
surprised the enemy at four in the morning, returning
with twenty-two carts full of provisions and war
material, sixty oxen, and some two hundred sheep
and goats. Meanwhile Marquez and his troopers
had passed through the enemy&rsquo;s lines unnoticed,
leaving the imperialists the poorer by one thousand
of their best men&mdash;no small loss to a garrison
already so reduced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The Juarists, now swelled by reinforcements to
about forty thousand men, continued to harass the
city by daily attacks from without, while their spies
kept them accurately informed of all that passed
within. The Emperor, unconscious of the treachery
by which he was surrounded, still looked confidently
for relief from Marquez. Days passed in ever-increasing
suspense, while the situation of the
besieged grew more and more critical. Marquez&rsquo;
enemies began openly to hint at treachery, and at
length even Maximilian lost faith. Now that it was
too late his eyes were opened to the real nature of his
&ldquo;friend,&rdquo; and, realizing that he had been betrayed,
he determined to send Prince Salm on another mission
to the capital&mdash;to arrest Marquez, if necessary,
and return at once with reinforcements. An attempt
was accordingly made on the twenty-second of April
to break through the enemy&rsquo;s lines, but the city was
by this time so closely invested that it was found
to be useless. Meanwhile the republicans, fearing
that the Emperor with his whole force might succeed
in escaping from the city, caused reports of
Marquez&rsquo; approach to be circulated by their spies,
while false despatches, purporting to arrive from the
capital, were smuggled through the lines in order to
soothe the imperialists with vain hopes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>But what of Marquez while all Quer&eacute;taro watched
so anxiously for his return? Where was he and
what was he doing? He had arrived safely at the
capital on the twenty-seventh of March with few
losses, and, finding the city of Puebla hard pressed
by the Juarist, Porfirio Diaz, determined to go to
its relief. Though well aware of the urgency of the
situation in Quer&eacute;taro, and the need of haste in
executing his mission, he seems to have troubled
himself little concerning it, and to have taken no
steps toward sending the promised aid. The relief
of Puebla he did indeed undertake, but here as in
Quer&eacute;taro he made so many blunders that the
attempt ended in utter failure and involved the
needless sacrifice of many of Maximilian&rsquo;s brave
Austrians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Downfall of the Mexican Empire</span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile the situation in Quer&eacute;taro
remained about the same from week to
week. Thanks to the reports spread by
republican spies, relief was still looked for, while
frequent skirmishes enlivened the monotony in
which both Miramon and Mejia distinguished
themselves. Nor were they altogether without
results, for on the twenty-seventh of April Miramon
routed twelve thousand of the besiegers, captured
twenty-one guns, and took a large number of prisoners.
Yet neither of these generals seemed able
to utilize their advantages. Whenever a victory
was won, precious moments were wasted in useless
celebrations, in true Mexican fashion, leaving the
enemy plenty of time to recover lost ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>At length, however, the Emperor was forced to
abandon all hope of Marquez&rsquo; return and as a last
resort began seriously to consider the possibility of
breaking through the enemy&rsquo;s siege lines to the
western plain whence they might be able to reach
the mountains beyond. Once there they would be
safe&mdash;for these were the native haunts of General
Mejia, who knew every foot of the country and was
certain to find support among the sturdy mountaineers&mdash;always
a loyal race. Thither, too, the
Juarists would be slow to follow. Being unwilling
to leave the city without any military protection,
Maximilian&rsquo;s first step was to issue a call for volunteers,
to which hundreds of the townsfolk responded
and were enrolled as recruits by Mejia, to whom
their organization was entrusted. Meanwhile Prince
Salm selected a body-guard of picked men for the
Emperor. The attempt was to be made early on the
morning of the fourteenth of May,&mdash;the chief command
of the expedition being intrusted to Colonel
Lopez, a proof of Maximilian&rsquo;s unbounded faith
in this scoundrel. As to the sequence of events,
Dr. Basch, who was an eye-witness, writes as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock on the night of the thirteenth,
a council of war was held at which it was decided to
defer our departure till the following night. This
was at Mejia&rsquo;s request, the number of volunteers
being so great he had been unable properly to arm or
organize them in so short a time, and it was upon
their help he largely depended for the success of the
undertaking. Preparations had all been completed.
We were ready for the march. Only such effects as
could be carried with us on our horses were to be
taken. The Emperor himself was very hopeful.
&lsquo;I am glad,&rsquo; he said to me on the afternoon of the
fourteenth, &lsquo;that the end has come at last and feel
sure we shall succeed, partly because my good
fortune has never yet failed me and also&mdash;call it
superstition if you will&mdash;because to-morrow is my
mother&rsquo;s name day&mdash;which is a good omen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s luggage was divided among the
escort&mdash;members of his suite each taking a part
of his papers among their effects. The contents of
His Majesty&rsquo;s privy purse were distributed between
Salm, Lieutenant-colonel Pradillo, the Emperor&rsquo;s
secretary, Blasio, Colonel Campos, commander of
the body-guard, myself, and Lopez, the latter of
whom expressed dissatisfaction on being handed
his share because it was in silver and small coin
instead of gold like the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock that night another postponement
was made till the fifteenth, this time at the request
of General Mendez, for what reason I am unable to
say. About eleven the Emperor held a conference
with Lopez concerning some details of the plan,
and, made wakeful by excitement, did not retire
until one. At half-past two he had me wakened.
I went at once to his room and found him suffering
with an attack of dysentery&mdash;a disease which had
been making havoc in both camps owing to bad food
and the effects of the rainy season. I stayed with
him nearly an hour till the pain was relieved, then
returned to my own room and lay down with my
clothes on. The convent was then wrapped in deep
stillness; not a sound was to be heard. Just before
five I was suddenly aroused by two men bursting
into my room, one of whom I recognized as Lieutenant
Jablonski. &lsquo;Where is Prince Salm?&rsquo; they
shouted, &lsquo;he must be awakened!&rsquo; and with these
words they rushed out again. I sprang up at once.
Something unusual must have occurred to bring them
to headquarters at that hour. Without stopping
to think about it, however, I roused my servant, who
was sleeping in the same room, ordered him to saddle
my horse as quickly as possible, and hastened in
quest of Salm, whom I found already up and dressed.
I asked him what was the matter. &lsquo;We are surprised,&rsquo;
was his answer. &lsquo;Make haste and tell F&uuml;rstenw&auml;rther
to have the hussars mount without delay.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had just delivered this message when the
Emperor&rsquo;s Mexican chamberlain, Severo, came and
informed me that His Majesty wished to speak with
me. Returning to his room, I found him already
dressed. &lsquo;I do not think it is anything serious,&rsquo; he
declared with the utmost calmness, &lsquo;but the enemy
have forced their way into the courtyard. Get
your pistol and follow me to the square.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grill, the steward, afterward told me during our
imprisonment that the Emperor did not lose his
presence of mind for a moment. While he was dressing
he had his sword placed by the door unsheathed,
to be at hand in case of need. In obedience to His
Majesty&rsquo;s command I went to my room to buckle
on my revolver and there my servant met me with
the news that he had been stopped by a strange
officer who had taken the saddle blankets from him.
Having myself given the order for the hussars to
mount, it was necessary for me to have my horse at
once if I was to accompany the Emperor, so I told
my servant to follow me and point out the officer
who had prevented his obeying my orders. We
met him in one of the passageways, wrapped in
one of the blankets and carrying the other on his
shoulder. As the Emperor had only spoken of the
enemy as having entered the courtyard, I naturally
supposed, meeting this man inside the convent, that
he and the ten soldiers with him were our men and
asked if he did not recognize me as the Emperor&rsquo;s
physician. He tried to evade me, pointing to a
staircase leading to the roof of the convent, and
saying, &lsquo;Your blankets are up there.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Still in the dark as to the meaning of all this,
and indignant at the unnecessary delay, I drew my
revolver, whereupon the officer cried to the soldiers,
&lsquo;<i>Desarme lo!</i>&rsquo; (Disarm him!) I saw a row of bayonets
pointed at me and heard the click of triggers
and in a flash the whole thing was clear to me.
Any attempt at resistance would have been madness,
so, escorted by the officer and his squad, I
mounted the steps to the convent roof, which to
my amazement I found crowded with republican
troops. &lsquo;You are my prisoner!&rsquo; said the officer,
now speaking for the first time. &lsquo;So I see!&rsquo; was my
angry rejoinder. My revolver was then taken away
from me, and Perez, for such was the officer&rsquo;s
name, began to search my pockets with a dexterity
that proved him no novice in the business. Naturally
the well-filled money belt did not escape his
deft fingers, nor my watch which I had with me, and
this unexpected booty caused him to treat me with
more favor. In spite of the danger of the situation,
I could not refrain from drawing out my surgical
case, which had been overlooked, and, offering it to
Perez, inquiring whether he would not like that also.
This voluntary gift, however, he did not accept nor
did he take my note-book. There being no bank
notes in Mexico, paper naturally did not interest
him as much as coin or valuables, and my papers
were left undisturbed in my pocket. I was then
taken to the tower where the Emperor had so often
exposed himself to the enemy&rsquo;s fire, and placed
under the guard of two men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>So much for the physician&rsquo;s experiences on that
eventful night. Meanwhile, after telling Dr. Basch
to get his pistol and follow him, Maximilian, accompanied
by Prince Salm, General Castillo, Lieutenant-colonel
Pradillo, and Secretary Blasio, went out into
the courtyard. At the gates they found one of
the enemy&rsquo;s guards stationed, and standing near by
were Colonel Lopez and Colonel Jos&eacute; Rincon Gallardo.
The latter, to whom the Emperor was well
known, said to the guard: &ldquo;Let them pass, they
are civilians,&rdquo; and Maximilian and his companions
walked out unmolested. From La Cruz they made
their way to Miramon&rsquo;s headquarters on the Cerro
de la Campa&ntilde;a, several other officers joining them
on the way. The lines everywhere were already in
the possession of the enemy and even the small
body of cavalry they found assembled at the foot
of the hill soon melted away, going over to the
enemy little by little as their fears overcame them.
Turning to Mejia, the Emperor asked if there was
no possibility of breaking through with a few faithful
followers, but Mejia sadly replied in the negative,
saying any such attempt would be useless. Resigning
himself to his fate, therefore, Maximilian ordered
the white flag hoisted and a few moments later
surrendered his sword to a republican officer who
galloped up. The Emperor was a prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>That afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock Escobedo sent the
following telegram to the Juarist minister of war
in Potosi:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;At three o&rsquo;clock this morning our troops captured
the convent La Cruz. The garrison were
taken prisoners, part of the enemy&rsquo;s troops having
retreated to Cerro de la Campa&ntilde;a in great disorder
and under fire from our artillery. About eight this
morning Maximilian with his generals Mejia and
Castillo surrendered at discretion. I beg to offer
the President my congratulations on this great
triumph of the national arms.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Mariano Escobedo.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>A mighty triumph, indeed, for fifty thousand men
to conquer a garrison of five thousand, exhausted
by famine and disease, and that only by an act of
treachery!</p>
<p>As to the manner and conditions of Lopez&rsquo; betrayal,
accounts vary. He is said to have been
promised as much as ten thousand piastres by
Escobedo. His accomplice in the plot was a certain
Anton Jablonski, but the whole affair was
managed with such adroitness that not one of the
Emperor&rsquo;s friends had a suspicion of it. Lopez
afterward published an emphatic denial of the
accusation, which was supported by Escobedo and
in which he had the audacity to appeal to Prince
Salm for confirmation. The latter&rsquo;s reply, written
during his imprisonment and after Maximilian&rsquo;s
death, leaves nothing to be desired in the way of
plain speaking. It runs in part as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Miguel Lopez, former imperial Mexican
colonel and author of the article entitled &lsquo;The
Capture of Quer&eacute;taro&rsquo;:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this defence, addressed by you to your countrymen,
to France, and to the world at large, you
appeal to me as witness that Quer&eacute;taro did not fall
by treachery and maintain that your statements
bear the stamp of perfect truth. Although I, as you
know, have been a prisoner of war for five months,
my sense of justice will no longer allow me to be
silent, for I can prove their utter falsity. You publicly
declare that Quer&eacute;taro was captured by force
of arms; that the Emperor commissioned you on
the night of the fourteenth of May to negotiate with
the enemy, his troops being completely demoralized
and all hope of escape abandoned; and you dare
any who maintain that Quer&eacute;taro fell by treachery
to appear and dispute your assertions. I accept
your challenge, therefore, and before the world proclaim
you a traitor with the blood of your former
sovereign and benefactor on your hands. It is not
true that the Emperor commissioned you to negotiate
with the enemy. I had the honor of conversing
with His Majesty that night, after you had left
him, and he had not then or at any other time the
faintest idea of treating with the republicans. If
his army was small, it was still brave and loyal
enough to have fought a way out through the
enemy&rsquo;s lines for its beloved sovereign, to whose
character, as you well know, such a course as you
describe would have been utterly foreign. This being
the case, permit me, Senor Lopez, to ask you
a few questions before the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you had been ordered to enter the
enemy&rsquo;s lines, did you return about two o&rsquo;clock with
a republican officer of high rank and bring him into
La Cruz, the Emperor&rsquo;s headquarters? Why did
you, contrary to the Emperor&rsquo;s wishes, and without
my knowledge, order the Hungarian hussars to
unsaddle, when I had already given them the
Emperor&rsquo;s commands to remain saddled all night?
Why, at such a dangerous time, did you remove from
the Emperor&rsquo;s headquarters the guard upon whom
the safety of La Cruz depended? Why were the
eight guns which stood on the square in front of the
convent turned with their muzzles toward the city?
Why, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, did you take
this republican general, dressed as a civilian and
armed with a revolver, all through our fortifications?
Why did you leave our lines before four o&rsquo;clock that
morning, still with this same officer, and return in a
quarter of an hour at the head of two of the enemy&rsquo;s
battalions and lead them into the inner court of
La Cruz, where you were met by your accomplice,
Lieutenant Jablonski? How did it happen that you
and Jablonski, both supposedly prisoners, should
have informed the Emperor of the enemy&rsquo;s presence
in La Cruz? How do you explain the fact that
when His Majesty, with General Castillo and myself,
were about to leave the convent, then already
surrounded by the enemy, we were allowed at a
word from you to pass as civilians, although the
Emperor must have been already recognized and
General Castillo and I were in full uniform? How
was it that after our capture some of the republican
officers named you as the traitor? How did it happen
that you, a prisoner, were always at liberty?
And, finally, how were you able to possess yourself
of the imperial papers and various articles belonging
to His Majesty, such as his silver toilet service,
which, by the way, have never appeared again?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;To all of this, Se&ntilde;or Miguel Lopez, you cannot
honestly and honorably reply; the facts speak for
themselves and proclaim you both traitor and murderer.
Why did you betray your Emperor and
benefactor? Because, in the first place, you wished
to be revenged on him for withholding from you
the General&rsquo;s commission which he had already
signed. In case you should not know his reason
for this, then learn now that it was because a brave
man, whose blood is also on your hands and whose
name I will not mention, lest you take revenge on
those he has left behind, had presented to His
Majesty a private document dismissing you from the
army for infamous conduct during Santa Anna&rsquo;s
presidency and forbidding your ever holding a
government office again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, secondly, Se&ntilde;or Lopez, you were moved
by fear. Seeing that something decisive must soon
occur and fearing, in case of our defeat, for your
future and for your life, you hoped by this shameful
treachery to clear your past account with the republicans,
as indeed you did. Your third attempt at
treason failed, for a short time after the Emperor
had been made prisoner, finding your hopes disappointed,
you sent a person known to us both to
him with offers to betray your new confederates.
In my presence this person attempted to pave the
way for you to approach the Emperor, overtures
that were naturally rejected with contempt. A
man may choose his own course in life, but he
must be true to his principles. You have not only
been false to yours but have also committed the
most infamous of all crimes&mdash;that of treason&mdash;and
broken the oath you took to the imperial
cause. The name of Miguel Lopez may become
famous, no doubt, but it will never be mentioned
in the annals of Mexico or of the world save with
deepest abhorrence and contempt.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Emperor&rsquo;s Imprisonment</span></h2>
<p>After Maximilian had surrendered his sword
to the republican commander on the Cerro
de la Campa&ntilde;a he was taken back to his
old quarters at the convent, his physician and two
attendants, Grill and Severo, being allowed to join
him later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was with a heavy heart,&rdquo; writes Dr. Basch,
&ldquo;that I approached the Emperor&rsquo;s door, before which
a guard was posted. I opened it and paused a
moment on the threshold to compose myself, but
His Majesty came up at once and embraced me,
weeping. Quickly controlling himself, however, he
pressed my hand and turned away, sighing deeply.
A mournful silence followed. Now for the first
time I perceived that Salm, Blasio, Pachta, and
Pradillo were also in the room. For a time the
Emperor paced up and down, lost in thought, but
at last he spoke, this time more calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am glad,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that it all happened
without more bloodshed. That much at least has been
accomplished. I feared for you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although he had been so ill the night before,
excitement had sustained him during the events
that had since occurred. Now, however, the attack
returned and he was forced to go to bed suffering
greatly. Having, in our present situation, no remedies
at hand to relieve his distress, I was greatly
surprised when the Emperor produced a small box
of pills which I had given him the night before.
&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he declared, &lsquo;how important it is not to
lose one&rsquo;s presence of mind. This morning when
we were surprised I remembered to put this in my
pocket.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maximilian&rsquo;s room had been completely rifled
during his absence. Personal effects, books, clothing,
and documents all had disappeared, having been
appropriated by Lopez as souvenirs of his former
benefactor. During the forenoon the Emperor was
visited by several of the republican officers, among
whom was Colonel Jos&eacute; Gallardo, who had permitted
him to leave La Cruz the preceding night&mdash;a
mistaken kindness, as it proved, for Maximilian, in
consequence, had been arrested in arms and thereby
made himself liable to that fatal decree of October
third, which he had tried to revoke on his way to
Orizaba.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Most of the imperial generals who had remained
loyal were confined in a room adjoining the Emperor&rsquo;s.
Mendez remained in hiding, but, his plan
of concealment being betrayed a few days later, he
was taken out and shot. Miramon had been shot
in the face with a revolver by one of his own adjutants
while attempting to rally his troops on the
Cerro, the morning of the surrender, and was at his
own quarters. The prisoners were treated with
scant consideration. A rich merchant of the town
supplied Maximilian&rsquo;s table, with the remains from
which his companions were obliged to content themselves.
The Emperor soon grew so much worse that
his physician became alarmed and asked that one
of the republican army surgeons might be called in.
Dr. Riva de Nejra was sent to visit the august
prisoner and advised a change of residence, declaring
the present one most unfit in his condition of
health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>On the morning of the seventeenth, therefore,
Maximilian was taken to the former convent,
Santa Teresa, in a carriage, guarded by a troop
of cavalry, his companions being forced to walk.
As they passed through the city, the streets were
deserted, the inhabitants considerately retiring into
their houses, the windows of which even were
closed. Not a soul was to be seen anywhere.
The new quarters of the prisoners consisted of
two large rooms, absolutely bare and empty. After
some trouble a bed and chairs were procured for
the Emperor&rsquo;s use, while the others were left to
make themselves comfortable on the floor of the
adjoining apartment. Fortunately they managed to
obtain some saddle blankets to sleep on and the Emperor
sent out and bought coverings, combs, brushes,
and soap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These republicans,&rdquo; says Dr. Basch, &ldquo;seem convinced
they are treating us with the greatest care
and magnanimity, their idea of humanity being
apparently to permit us to breathe. Unless we can
wait on ourselves we must go hungry and dirty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>In spite of these hardships, however, the change
made a perceptible improvement in Maximilian&rsquo;s
health, and his painful symptoms gradually disappeared.
Juarez&rsquo; delay in taking any action in
regard to the fate of the prisoners encouraged the
Emperor&rsquo;s friends to expect a favorable outcome of
the affair&mdash;a hope that was rudely dispelled, however,
when the Princess Salm arrived at Quer&eacute;taro
on the twentieth of May and revealed to her husband
the danger in which Maximilian really stood.
It was apparent even to the republicans that Juarez
was determined to have his life. The Princess made
the most heroic efforts to save him, shrinking from
no dangers and no exertion in his behalf, but all in
vain. The Emperor&rsquo;s guard was not always strictly
kept, and had not treachery lurked at every turn,
his escape might have been effected. Such an
attempt was finally made, indeed, but it was then
too late.</p>
<p>On the twenty-second of May Maximilian was
again transferred, this time to the Capuchin monastery,
with Prince Salm and Generals Mejia and
Miramon. The other officers, Dr. Basch, and the
Emperor&rsquo;s servants were left behind, expecting to
follow shortly. As hour after hour passed, however,
and no one came, feeling that anything was possible
in this barbarous country, they were seized with
the fear that Maximilian and his companions might
have been already shot without any warning. At
last, however, an officer appeared, about eight o&rsquo;clock
in the evening, with the long-looked-for orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first person I saw in the monastery,&rdquo; relates
Dr. Basch, &ldquo;was Salm. &lsquo;Where is the Emperor?&rsquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His Majesty is in the crypt,&rsquo; he replied, but
quickly added, seeing my horror at these words,
&lsquo;Calm yourself, he is alive, but really in the crypt.
I will take you to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the door was opened a rush of cold air greeted
me, rank with dampness and decay. In the far
corner of a huge vault, the burial-place of the monastery,
was a bed, and on it lay the Emperor reading
C&aelig;sar. A small table beside him held a lighted
candle. &lsquo;They have not had time to prepare a
room for me,&rsquo; he remarked, smiling quietly, &lsquo;so I am
obliged temporarily to take up my abode with the
dead.&rsquo; I spent that night in the crypt alone with
the Emperor, making my bed on a large slab apparently
used as a bier, but after the hours of anxiety
I had endured that afternoon, I had no trouble in
sleeping even amid those surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bitter as Juarez was against Maximilian, he was
not in Quer&eacute;taro at this time, but at Potosi, and
therefore cannot be held responsible for the atrocious
treatment accorded the unfortunate Emperor, whose
calm and cheerful acceptance of these indignities
cannot but rouse the deepest admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The next day he was taken from the crypt and
lodged in a dark narrow cell, similar to those assigned
his companions in misfortune, all opening on a small
court so that the prisoners could be easily guarded.
It soon became evident that there was no hope of
any compromise in the Emperor&rsquo;s case. Juarez
insisted that it should be decided by a Mexican
court-martial&mdash;the outcome of which was a foregone
conclusion. Maximilian&rsquo;s death had already
been determined upon and any trial would be merely
a pretext to throw dust in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>Princess Salm, with the aid of a German merchant,
named Stephen, and the vice-consul from
Hamburg, made another attempt at rescue, which
might have proved successful had not Maximilian
refused to go without Miramon and Mejia, who
were to be tried with him. Miramon appears to
have revealed the plan to his wife, who, in turn,
betrayed it to the enemy, so it resulted in only
stricter measures. All the prisoners were removed
from the Capuchin monastery with the exception of
Maximilian and his two generals, over whom a
much stronger guard was placed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>On the twelfth of June, 1867, General Escobedo
issued an order arraigning Ferdinand Maximilian,
Archduke of Austria, and his confederates, the &ldquo;so-called&rdquo;
generals, Don Miguel Miramon and Don
Tomas Mejia, before a court-martial to answer for
crimes against the nation and against law and
order. The charges against Maximilian were thirteen
in number, an absurd and incongruous medley, the
chief of which were that he had broken his personal
guarantees; that he had served as an instrument
of the French; and that he had assumed the position
of a usurper and authorized atrocities of every
description, such as the decree of October 3, 1865.</p>
<p>The trial opened at eight o&rsquo;clock on the morning
of June thirteenth in the Iturbide theatre, the
interior of which was brilliantly illuminated, the
galleries filled with spectators, all of whom displayed
the deepest interest in the proceedings. At the
right sat the judges, consisting of a lieutenant-colonel
and six captains, all very young and selected
with little or no regard for the important questions
involved. Opposite them were placed the benches
for the accused and their advocates, Generals Mejia
and Miramon arriving at the theatre about nine in
a carriage under a strong guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The president opened the session, and the attorney
for the government, Manuel Aspiroz, read the
charges, together with the Emperor&rsquo;s protest against
this form of trial and the legality of all steps taken
against his person under the law of January 25,
1862, which was intended for native rebels and
not applicable to him as a foreigner. Lastly, medical
evidence in regard to the Emperor&rsquo;s condition
of health was produced, with a petition for more
healthful accommodations.</p>
<p>General Mejia was first summoned to answer
before this tribunal, and his advocate, Vega, made
a brilliant speech in his defence, dwelling on his
bravery and loyalty as well as the distinguished
services he had rendered to his native land. Miramon&rsquo;s
attorneys, Jauregui and Moreno, employed
the same line of argument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Maximilian did not appear in person before the
court. He was defended by two of the foremost
lawyers in Mexico, Vazquez and Ortega, both
distinguished for learning and eloquence. They
directed their main arguments against the competency
of such a court for the case. Maximilian
was not a usurper, as charged, declared Vazquez,
for he had come by invitation of a representative
council, confirmed by popular vote. He had refused,
in fact, to accept the crown until such vote had been
assured. Whether this had been given fraudulently,
he, as a foreigner on the other side of the ocean, had
no means of discovering, nor had he any reason to
regard himself as other than a legitimate sovereign&mdash;the
ovation accorded him on his arrival naturally
tending to strengthen him in this conviction. He
had brought no troops but came peaceably, accompanied
only by his household. Neither had he
served as a tool for the French, for from the very
first he had striven against their interference; the
constant friction between him and the French commanders
having finally led to the withdrawal of the
French troops.</p>
<p>Ortega protested vigorously against the imputation
of Maximilian&rsquo;s cruelty. The severe decree of
October 3, 1865, was issued on the advice of his
ministry and in the belief that Juarez had abandoned
Mexican territory. Its object had been chiefly to
intimidate, for no man ever sued in vain for mercy
from Maximilian, whose clemency and magnanimity
were well known. He concluded with an appeal to
the honor and sympathy of the republicans, urging
them not to abuse their victory and stain their laurels
with a bloody and useless execution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>But his defenders&rsquo; brilliant eloquence was powerless
to save Maximilian. His sentence had been fixed
long since. The whole trial was the merest farce,
a spectacle prepared by Juarez and his friends. It
was most fitting that a theatre should have been
chosen for its performance!</p>
<p>The public session of the court ended on the
fourteenth of June. At eleven o&rsquo;clock that night
the Emperor Maximilian and his two generals were
unanimously pronounced guilty and condemned to
be shot, Escobedo confirming the sentence on the
sixteenth and ordering the execution to take place
that afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Mexico was now completely in the hands of the
Juarists, with the exception of Vera Cruz and the
capital, where Marquez was playing a singular game
and needlessly sacrificing the Emperor&rsquo;s brave
Austrians. With the downfall of the imperial cause,
however, this scoundrel passes out of our history.
Once, during his imprisonment, Maximilian said to
his physician: &ldquo;If both Marquez and Lopez were
given to me to deal with as I chose, I would free the
coward Lopez, but Marquez, the cold-blooded and
deliberate traitor, I would hang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of Maximilian and his Generals</span></h2>
<p>The news that the Emperor and his two
generals, Mejia and Miramon, had been sentenced
to death, aroused widespread sympathy
and Juarez was besieged with petitions for
mercy, even Garibaldi, who certainly was no friend
to the house of Hapsburg, being among the pleaders.
The Prussian ambassador, Baron von Magnus, hastened
to Potosi to intercede personally in behalf of
Maximilian, and used every effort to secure a pardon,
but in vain. All that he was able to obtain was a
reprieve of two days, the execution of the sentence
being postponed till seven o&rsquo;clock on the morning
of the nineteenth.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption"><i>LAST MOMENTS OF EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Prince Salm being still a prisoner and powerless
to act, his wife made one last desperate attempt
to bring about the Emperor&rsquo;s escape by flight, but
again the plan was frustrated by the fatal treachery
that seemed to pursue Maximilian at every turn in
Mexico. The Princess Salm was put into a carriage
and sent out of Quer&eacute;taro under a military guard,
while all the diplomatic representatives were ordered
by Escobedo to leave the city at two hours&rsquo; notice.
Meanwhile the Emperor and his companions prepared
for death. They received the sacrament from
Father Soria and spent their last hours communing
with the confessors who were to accompany them
on their last journey. Maximilian, calm and serene
as in happier days, conversed cheerfully with Dr.
Basch and his lawyers, Ortega and Vazquez, who
had come to bid him farewell. On parting with the
physician he charged him to carry back to his
friends and family in Vienna a report of the siege
and of his last days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have done my
duty as a soldier and die a good Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock, the time originally set for the
execution, all was ready for the last march to the
Cerro de la Campa&ntilde;a. The officer in command of
the firing squad begged for forgiveness with tears in
his eyes, but the Emperor calmed him, saying: &ldquo;You
are a soldier and must obey your orders.&rdquo; For a
whole hour they waited for the summons, but none
came. At last, about four o&rsquo;clock, an officer arrived
with the announcement that the execution had been
postponed till the nineteenth, the order having only
just arrived by wire from Potosi an hour before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is hard,&rdquo; exclaimed Maximilian, &ldquo;for I had
already finished with the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He availed himself of the delay, however, to dictate
several farewell letters to his physician, among them
one of thanks to his captive officers for their loyalty
and a touching appeal to his implacable enemy,
Juarez, to prevent further bloodshed and let his death
serve to promote the peace and welfare of his adopted
country. Even now Baron von Magnus made one
more effort to save the Emperor&rsquo;s life. On the
eighteenth of June he sent a telegram to the Juarist
minister, Lerdo de Tejada, offering to secure guarantees
from all the leading sovereigns of Europe that
none of the three prisoners should ever again set
foot on Mexican soil or disturb the country in
any way. But Juarez was inexorable. In reply to
the Baron&rsquo;s despatch Minister Tejada stated that
the President of the Republic was convinced that the
cause of justice and the future peace of the country
required the death of the prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>At last the fatal morning of Wednesday, June
19, 1867, dawned. At five o&rsquo;clock Father Soria
came to celebrate mass, and at half past six the
republican officer who had charge of the execution
arrived. The three prisoners, dressed in black,
entered carriages, each with his confessor, and were
driven slowly to the place of execution, which was
surrounded by a guard of four thousand men. On
alighting, the Emperor embraced his two companions,
promising they should soon meet in another
world, and then walked with dignity to the spot
assigned at the foot of a hill in front of a shattered
wall. Here he placed Miramon in the centre,
saying, &ldquo;A brave soldier is respected by his sovereign;
permit me to yield you the place of honor.&rdquo;
Turning to Mejia, who had been unnerved by the
sight of his wife running through the streets frantic
with grief, he said: &ldquo;General, what has not been
rewarded on earth will certainly be in heaven.&rdquo;
After distributing some gold pieces among the
soldiers who were to do the firing, he said in a
firm voice: &ldquo;May my blood be the last shed in
sacrifice for this country, and if more is required,
let it be for the good of the nation, never by
treason.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The signal to fire was then given and the three
fell simultaneously, Maximilian&rsquo;s body pierced by
six bullets. The Mexican Empire had ceased to
exist, and the noble Hapsburger had laid down his
life for the welfare of an ungrateful people.</p>
<p>General Escobedo had promised the Emperor
before his death that his body should be delivered
to Baron von Magnus to be taken back to Europe,
yet in spite of this the ambassador had much trouble
in obtaining possession of it. He was ill himself
for a time with fever and had to be taken to Potosi.
After many delays, however, the remains were
finally given into his custody on November twelfth
and, attended by Vice-admiral von Tegetthof, his two
adjutants, and Doctor Basch, were taken to Vera
Cruz with a cavalry escort of one hundred men, and
placed on board the <i>Novara</i>, the same vessel which
but three years before had conveyed Maximilian to
his adopted country and to his doom. On the
fifteenth of January, 1868, the <i>Novara</i> arrived at
Trieste. A special train conveyed the coffin to
Vienna, where, three days later, the body of Archduke
Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria was buried
in the imperial vault in the Capuchin church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>As there may be some curiosity as to the later
history of those who so shamefully betrayed
the Emperor Maximilian, a word as to
their fate may not be amiss.</p>
<p>His murderer, Juarez, proved himself unable to
restore peace and tranquillity in the country. He
attained his ambition, however, when he was again
made President, and this sufficed for him. He did
not long survive the victim of his cruelty and revenge,
dying, in Mexico, July 18, 1872. His friend, Escobedo,
received from General Mejia his only son as
a legacy&mdash;one that was to prove a constant reminder
of his treachery. Twice the Juarist chief
had owed his life to Mejia&rsquo;s generosity, yet he had
not hesitated in turn to sign the latter&rsquo;s death-warrant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Napoleon Third&rsquo;s subsequent career has passed
into history. Losing battle after battle, and finally
his throne, in the war of 1870, he surrendered his
sword to King William First of Prussia on the second
of September of that year and was taken to
Wilhelmsh&ouml;he at Cassel as a prisoner of war, where
he received very different treatment from that
accorded the captive Emperor in Quer&eacute;taro. After
the conclusion of peace he retired to England, where
he died at Chiselhurst.</p>
<p>A yet more tragic fate befell Marshal Fran&ccedil;ois
Achille Bazaine. During the Franco-Prussian War
he was besieged in Metz by Prince Friedrich Karl
and forced to surrender with about one hundred and
seventy thousand men. He was taken to Cassel,
where he shared Napoleon&rsquo;s imprisonment. Accused
by the French not only of cowardice and incapacity
but also of treason, he was tried by court-martial
and condemned to death. There being no bloodthirsty
Juarez in France, however, the sentence was
commuted to twenty years&rsquo; imprisonment on the
Island of Sainte Marguerite, near Cannes. He
succeeded in escaping, with the help of his wife, and
fled to Madrid, where he lived in poverty and obscurity
and died in 1888, forgotten by the world and
deserted by his wife, who returned to her native
Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Marquez escaped from the city of Mexico, hiding
the first night, it is said, in a coffin, and, continuing
his flight at daylight toward the north, succeeded in
reaching Texas. His subsequent history is unknown.
After betraying the imperial army, Lopez prepared
to enjoy the reward of his treason, but it was flatly
refused him. Despised alike by friend and foe, and
even by his own wife, he led a wretched existence,
employing himself in vain attempts to vindicate his
treachery.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Doubtless Maximilian made many grave mistakes,
but from the foregoing pages it is plain that
both he and his wife went to Mexico with the noblest
aims and full of enthusiasm for the mission, to the
difficulties of which they finally succumbed. Yet
the sacrifice was not wholly in vain, for the last
struggle has served to embalm the memory of the
Emperor Maximilian First of Mexico as a brave
and chivalrous prince, while that of his enemies is
held in merited contempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>On the spot where Maximilian and his two generals
so gallantly met their fate on the nineteenth of
June, 1867, a memorial chapel has been erected, to
which throngs of Mexicans of all classes annually
make a pilgrimage on the anniversary of that day,
as indeed they did previously, when only a simple
gravestone marked the place of death.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
